<h2 class="no-num no-toc">Abstract</h2>

<p>This specification defines features often used when printing books or magazines. Using this functionality, documents written in HTML can be presented in a book-like manner, either on screen or on paper. Real books are being published with functionality described in this specification. 

<h2 class="no-num no-toc">Status</h2>

<p>This specification is in the process of establishing itself in WHATWG. As such, the term "Living Standard" indicates a goal. However, most of this specification has been interoperably implemented and is in daily use by publishers. Implementation coverage is <a href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/coverage.html">documented here</a>.

<h2 class="no-num no-toc">Table of Contents</h2>

<!--toc-->


<h2 class="no-num">Goals</h2>

<p>The main goal of this specification is to enable authors to write books in HTML or other markup languages. Book publishing is a craft with long traditions and certain formatting conventions have developed over time. This specification adds functionality to CSS so that style sheets can express commonly used features in printed books, on-screen books, and page description languages. These features are also often used by magazines, in brochures, and in other publications.


<h2>Conformance</h2>

<p>All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are
non-normative, as are all sections explicitly marked non-normative.
Everything else in this specification is normative.

<p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", <!--"SHALL", "SHALL
NOT",--> "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this specification are to be
interpreted as described in RFC2119. For readability, these words do
not appear in all uppercase letters in this specification.
<span data-anolis-ref>RFC2119</span>

<p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps
may be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is
equivalent.

<p id="hardwareLimitations">User agents may impose
implementation-specific limits on otherwise unconstrained inputs,
e.g. to prevent denial of service attacks, to guard against running
out of memory, or to work around platform-specific limitations.



<h2>Running headers and footers</h2>

<p>To aid navigation in printed material, headers and footers are often
printed in the page margins. <span data-anolis-ref>CSSPAGE</span> describes how to place
headers and footers on a page, but not how to fetch headers and
footers from elements in the document. This specification offers two
ways to achieve this. The first mechanism is <dfn>named strings</dfn>
which <em>copies</em> the text (without style, structure, or replaced
content) of an element for later reuse in margin boxes. The second
mechanism is <dfn>running elements</dfn> which <em>moves</em> elements
(with style, structure, and replaced content) into a margin box.



<h3>Named strings</h3>

<div class=code-example>
<a href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/named-strings.html">html</a><br>
<a class=pass href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/named-strings-ah.pdf">AH</a>
<a class=almost href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/named-strings-pr.pdf">PR</a>
</div>


<!--
<p>Named strings are discussed both in the CSS3 Generated and Replaced
Content (section 9) and in CSS3 Paged Media (several places). For a
proposed definition of the property, one has to go back to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/06/WD-css3-page-19990623">CSS3 draft from 1999</a>
1999:
-->

<p>A Named string is a variable that can hold a string of text. Named
strings are created with the 'string-set' property which copies a
string of text into a named string. Only text is copied; not style,
structure, or replaced content.

<div class=code-example>
<a href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/e-string-set-motivational.html">html</a><br>
<a class=pass href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/e-string-set-motivational-ah.pdf">AH</a>
<a class=pass href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/e-string-set-motivational-pr.pdf">PR</a>
</div>

<div class="example">

<p>Consider this code:

<pre>
h1 { string-set: heading content() }
</pre>

<p>Whenever an <code>h1</code> element is encountered,
its textual content is copied into a named string called
<em>heading</em>. The string can later be retrieved in the 'content'
property:

<pre>
@page { @top-center { content: string(heading) }}
</pre>

</div>


<h4>Setting named strings: the 'string-set' property</h4>

<table class=propdef>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Name:</em>
      <td><dfn>string-set</dfn>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Value:</em>
      <td>[[ &lt;identifier> &lt;content-list>] [, &lt;identifier> &lt;content-list>]* ] | none
    <tr>
      <td><em>Initial:</em>
      <td>none
    <tr>
      <td><em>Applies to:</em>
      <td>all elements
    <tr>
      <td><em>Inherited:</em>
      <td>no
    <tr>
      <td><em>Percentages:</em>
      <td>N/A
    <tr>
      <td><em>Media:</em>
      <td>all
    <tr>
      <td><em>Computed&nbsp;value:</em>
      <td>as specified value
</table>

<p>The 'string-set' property accepts a comma-separated list of named
strings. Each named string is followed by a content list that
specifies which text to copy into the named string. Whenever an
element with value of 'string-set' different from ''none'' is
encountered, the named strings are assigned their respective value.

<p name=content-list>&lt;content-list> expands to one or more of these values, in any order:

<dl>

<dt>&lt;string&gt;
<dd>a string, e.g. "foo"

<dt>&lt;counter&gt;
<dd>the counter() or counters() function, as per <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#counter">CSS 2.1 section 4.3.5</a> <span data-anolis-ref>CSS</span>

<dt>content(text)

<dd>The textual content of the element, not including the content of its ::before and ::after pseudo-element. The content of the element's descendants, including their respective ::before and ::after pseudo-elements, are included in the returned content. This is the default value, so ''content()'' is equivalent to ''content(text)''.

<dt>content(before)

<dd>The textual content of the ::before pseudo-element of the element.

<dt>content(after)

<dd>The textual content of the ::after pseudo-element of the element.

<dt>content(first-letter)

<dd>The first letter of the textual content of the element. The definition of a letter is the same as for the :first-letter pseudo-element, as per <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html#first-letter">CSS 2.1 section 5.12.2</a>.

</dl>

<p>The syntax is formally described as:

<pre>
  &lt;content-list&gt; = [ &lt;string&gt; | &lt;counter&gt; | [ content( [ before | after | first-letter ] ) ] ]+
</pre>

<p>Named strings can only hold the result of one assignment; whenever
a new assignment is made to a named string, its old value is replaced.

<p class='note'>User agents, however, must be able to remember the
several assignments as the ''string()'' functional value
(described below) can refer to different assignments.

<p>The scope of a named string is the page of the element to which the
'string-set' property is attached and subsequent pages.

<!--
<p>The name space of named strings is different from other sets of
names in CSS.
-->


<div class=code-example>
<a href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/e-string-set-counter.html">html</a><br>
<a class=pass href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/e-string-set-counter-ah.pdf">AH</a>
<a class=pass href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/e-string-set-counter-pr.pdf">PR</a>
</div>


<div class="example">
<pre>
h2 {
  string-set: header "Chapter " counter(header) ": " content();
  counter-increment: header;
}

&lt;h2>Europa&lt;/h2>
</pre>

<p>Note that the string called "header" is different from the counter with the same name. The above code may result in the string called "header" is set to "Chapter 1: Europa".

</div>


<p>The textual content of the named string is processed as if 'white-space: normal' has been set.

<div class=code-example>
<a href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/e-string-set-white-space.html">html</a><br>
<a class=pass href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/e-string-set-white-space-ah.pdf">AH</a>
<a class=pass href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/string-set-set-white-space-pr.pdf">PR</a>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p>In this example, the header will consist of three words ("In the beginning") with normal spacing between the words.
<pre>
h2 {
  string-set: header "In " ' ' content();
}

&lt;h2>   the    beginning&lt;/h2>
</pre>
</div>


<div class="example">
<p>In this example, the named string called <em>index</em> will hold the first letter of &lt;dt&gt; elements.
<pre>
dt { string-set: index content(first-letter) }
</pre>
<p>One-letter running headers are often used in dictionaries. 
</div>

<p>The textual content is copied regardless of values on other CSS properties. 

<div class=code-example>
<a href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/e-string-set-other-declarations.html">html</a><br>
<a class=pass href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/e-string-set-other-declarations-ah.pdf">AH</a>
<a class=pass href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/e-string-set-other-declarations-pr.pdf">PR</a>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p>In this example, the first four declarations have no effect on the on the named string copied in the last declaration:

<pre>
title {
  display: none;
  content: "foo"; 
  text-transform: uppercase;
  text-replace: "foo" "bar";
  string-set: tittel content();
}
</pre>
</div>


<h4>Using named strings</h4>

<p>The content of named strings can be recalled by using the
''string()'' value on the 'content' property. The ''string()'' value has
one required argument: the name of the string.

<div class="example">
<pre>
@page { @top-center { content: string(header) }}
@page { @right-middle { content: string(index) }}
@page { @top-left { content: string(entry) }}
h1 { string-set: header "Chapter " counter(chapter) content() }
dt { string-set: index first-letter, entry content() }
</pre>
<!--h1 { string-set: header "Chapter " counter(chapter) contents }
dt { string-set: index content-first-letter, entry contents }-->

</div>

<p>If the value of the named string is changed by an element on a certain
page, the named string may have several values on that page. In order to specify
which of these values should be used, an optional second argument is accepted
on the ''string()'' value. This argument can have one of four keywords:

<ul>
<li>''first'': the value of the first assignment on the page is used. If there is no assignment on the page, the named string's entry value is used. The entry value is the value held by the string at the end of the previous page. ''first'' is the default value.

<li>''start'': the value of the first assignment on the page is used if the element begins the page or the named string has not been assigned a value. Otherwise, the named string's entry value is used.

<li>''last'': the named string's exit value is used

<li>''first-except'': similar to ''first'', except on the page where the value was assigned. On that page, the empty string is used.

</ul>

<p>The syntax of the ''string()'' value is:

<pre>
  string( <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#custom-idents">&lt;custom-ident&gt;</a> [ , [ first | start | last | first-except ]]? )
</pre>

<p>The assignment is considered to take place on the first page where a content box representing the element occurs. If the element does not have any content boxes (e.g., if 'display: none' is set), the assignment is considered to take place on the page where the first content box would have occured if the element had been in the normal flow.

<div class="example">
<p>In this example, the first term on the page will be shown in the top left corner and the last term on the page will be shown in the top right corner. In top center of the page, the first letter of first term will be shown.
<pre>
@page { @top-left { content: string(term, first) }}
@page { @top-right { content: string(term, last) }}
@page { @top-center { content: string(index, first) }}
dt { string-set: index content(first-letter), term content(text) }
</pre>
</div>

<div class="example">

<p>Given this CSS code:

<pre>
h2 { string-set: header content() }
</pre>

<p>The value of the <em>header</em> string 

<table class=string-set-example>
<tr>
<td>page#<td>HTML code<td>first<td>start<td>last<td>first-except

...
&lt;h2>Oceania&lt;/h2>
..

</pre>
<td>Europe
<td>Europe
<td>Oceania
<td>
</table>

</div>


<div class="example">
<p>In this example, the term that is being described at the start of the page is shown in the top left header.
<pre>
@page { @top-left { content: string(term, start) }}
dt { string-set: term content() }
</pre>
</div>

<div class="example">
<pre>
@page { @top-left { content: string(term, first) }}
@page { @top-right { content: string(term, last) }}
@page { @top-center { content: string(index, first) }}
dt { string-set: index content(first-letter), term content(text) }
</pre>
</div>



<div class="example">
<p>In this example, the header in the top center will be blank on pages where 'h1' elements appear. On other pages, the string of the previous 'h1' element will be shown.
<pre>
@page { @top-center { content: string(chapter, first-except) }}
h1 { string-set: chapter content() }
</pre>
</div>

<p>If the named string referred to in a 'string()' value has not been
assigned a value, the empty string is used.


<h3>Running elements</h3>

<p>Named strings, as described above, can only hold textual content; any
style, structure or replaced content associated with the element is
ignored. To overcome this limitation, a way of moving elements into
running headers and footers is introduced.

<p>Elements that are moved into headers and footers are repeated on
several pages; they are said to be <em>running elements</em>. To
support running elements, a new value &ndash; running() &ndash; is
introduced on the 'position' property. It has one required argument:
the name by which the running element can be referred to. A running
element is not shown in its natural place; there it is treated as if
'display: none' had been set. Instead, the running element is
displayed when referred to by the ''element()'' value.

<p>Like counters and named strings, the name of a running element is chosen by
the style sheet author, and the names have a separate namespace. A
running element can hold one element, including its pseudo-elements
and its descendants. Whenever a new element is assigned to a running
element, the old element is lost.

<p class='note'>User agents, however, must be able to remember the
result of more than one assignment as the ''element()'' value
(described below) can refer to different assignments.

<p>Running elements inherit through their normal place in the
structure of the document.


<div class="example">
<pre>
title { position: running(header) }
@page { @top-center {
  content: element(header) }
}
</pre>
</div>

<!--
<div class="example remove">
<p>In this example, the element is copied into the running header but it also keeps its normal place.

<pre>
title { position: running(header), normal }
@page { @top-center {
  content: element(header) }
}
</pre>
</div>
-->


<p>Like the ''string()'' value, the ''element()'' value accepts an
optional second argument. The syntax is defined as:

<pre>
  element( <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#custom-idents">&lt;custom-ident&gt;</a> [ , [ first | start | last | first-except ]]? )
</pre>

<p>The keywords have the same meaning as for the ''string()'' value. 

<p>The ''element()'' value is only allowed on the 'content' property within a margin box. The ''element()'' value cannot be combined with any other values.

<div class="example">
<p>In this example, the header is hidden from view in all media types
except print. On printed pages, the header is displayed top center on
all pages, except where h1 elements appear.

<pre>
&lt;style>
  div.header { display: none }
  @media print {
  div.header {
    display: block;
    position: running(header);
  }
  @page { @top-center { content: element(header, first-except) }}
&lt;/style>
...
&lt;div class="header">Introduction&lt;/div>
&lt;h1 class="chapter">An introduction&lt;/div>

</pre>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p>This code illustrates how to change the running header on one page in the middle of a run of pages:

<pre>
...
&lt;style>
@page { @top-center {
  content: element(header, first) }}
.header { position: running(header) }
.once { font-weight: bold }
&lt;/style>
...
&lt;div class="header">Not now&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Da di ha di da di ...
  &lt;span class="header once">NOW!&lt;/span>
  &lt;span class="header">Not now&lt;/span>
  ... da di ha di hum.&lt;/p>
...
</pre>

The header is "Not now" from the outset, due to the "div" element. The
first "span" element changes it to "<b>NOW!</b>" on the page where the
"span" element would have appeared. The second "span" element, which
would have appeared on the same page as the first is not used because the
''first'' keyword has been specified. However, the second "span"
element still sets the exit value for "header" and this value is
used on subsequent pages.
</div>



<h2>Leaders</h2>

<div class=code-example>
<a href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/leaders.html">html</a><br>
<a class=pass href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/leaders-ah.pdf">AH</a>
<a class=almost href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/leaders-pr.pdf">PR</a>
</div>


<p>A leader is a visual pattern that guides the eye. Typically,
leaders are used to visually connect an entry in a list with a
corresponding code. For example, there are often leaders between
titles and page numbers in a table of contents (TOC). Another example
is the phone book where there are leaders between a name and a
telephone number.

<p>In CSS3, a leader is composed of series of glyphs through the
''leader()'' value on the 'content' property. The functional notation
accepts two values. The first describes the glyph pattern that makes up the
leader. The syntax is:

<pre>
  leader( [ dotted | solid | space |  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#strings">&lt;string&gt;</a> ] )
</pre>

<p>Using the keyword values is equivalent to setting a string value.
The table below shows the equivalents:

<table class=border>
<tr><th>Keyword<th>String<th>Unicode characters
<tr><td>leader(dotted)<td>leader('. ')<td>\002E \0020
<tr><td>leader(solid)<td>leader('_')<td>\005F
<tr><td>leader(space)<td>leader(' ')<td>\0020
</table>


<p>The string inside the parenthesis is called the <dfn>leader
string</dfn>. The leader string must be shown in full at least once,
thereby pushing other content to the side (in the writing direction of
the element to which the leader is attached). The leader string
establishes the minimum length of the leader. If there is empty space
on the line, the leader is expanded by repeating it as many times as
possible. The expansion of a leader from its minimum length never
causes line breaks to change. At the end of the leader, a partial
leader string may be shown.

<p>Line-breaking characters inside leader strings must be ignored. A list of line-breaking characters are found in 
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/standard/reports/tr13/tr13-5.html">[Unicode
Technical Report #13]</a>. Other white space characters are collapsed according to the values of
white-space properties. A leader consisting only of whitespace
characters is called a <dfn>whitespace leader</dfn>.


<p>To determine the length of the leaders, user agents must do the
following for each line where a leader appears:

<ol>
<li>Lay out the content with leaders of minimum lengths.

<li>Determine the empty space on the line. The empty space is the difference between the width of the line box (as per <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#line-box">CSS 2.1, section 9.4.2</a>) and the formatted content in the line box. For table cells in automatic table layout, leaders may influence the layout by enlarging the "maximum cell width" (as per <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/tables.html#auto-table-layout">CSS 2.1 17.5.2.2</a>).

<li>Distribute the empty space between all leaders on the line and
fill the empty space with the specified leader patterns. Glyphs must
not be shown partially. All leaders on the line should, to the extent
possible, have the same length. This may not always be possible as the
minimum leader length must be honored.

</ol>


<div class="example">
<p>By adding a leader to the ::after pseudo-element, a leader is added after the content of an element:
<pre>
h1::after { content: leader(dotted) }

&lt;h1>Dotted news&lt;/h1>
</pre>
<p>The formatted result may be:
<pre>
|Dotted news...................|
</pre>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p>By setting 'white-space: pre', the white space in the leader string is preserved:
<pre>
h1::after { 
  content: leader('  -  ');
  white-space: pre; 
}
&lt;h1>Dashing news&lt;/h1>
</pre>
<p>The formatted result may be:
<pre>
|Dashing news  -    -    -    -|
</pre>
</div>

<div class="example">

<p>If a leader is set on an inline element inside a justified paragraph, there will not be any empty space on the line. Therefore, the leader is shown only once. 

<pre>
span::after { 
  content: leader('...');
}

&lt;p>A paragraph with a &ltspan>span&lt;/span> inside.
</pre>

would be formatted as:

<pre>
A paragraph with a span... inside.
</pre>

</div>




<div class="example">
<p>The presence of a leader may influence tables. Consider this example with two table cells in one row:

<pre>
td.leader::after { content: leader('..') }

&lt;table style="width: 30em">
&lt;tr>&lt;td class=leader>foo&lt;/td> &lt;td>bar&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>
&lt;/table>
</pre>

<p>In UAs that don't do leaders, the two cells will have the same width
and the table cells could be rendered like this:

<pre>
|foo                             |bar                           |
</pre>

<p>When leaders are supported, the <em>maximum cell width</em> of the
first cell grows, and the table cell could be rendered like this:

<pre>
|foo........................................................|bar|
</pre>

<!--<p>(The '|' charaters mark vertical cell edges in the figures above.)-->
</div>

<div class="example">

<p>A table of contents often use leaders to visually connect a chapter
title with the corresponding page number. This can be achieved with code like:

<pre>
ul.toc a::after {
  content: leader(". . . ") target-counter(attr(href url), page);
}
</pre>

<p>The formatted result could be:

<pre>
Africa ...........1
America...........9
Antarctica.......56
Asia............134
</pre>

</div>

<p>The appearance of leaders is influenced by the same set of properties that influence the appearance of fixed strings. 

<div class="example">
<p>The same properties can affect the presentation of the fixed string and the leader.

<pre> 
content: "...";
content: leader("...");
</pre>

<div class="example">
<p>Line numbers sometimes displayed on the side of poetry, for reference purposes. In this example, a counter is dsplayed on every other line and pushed to the right by an invisible leader. 

<pre>
@page { counter-reset: line }
.line { counter-increment: line }
.line:nth-of-type(2n+1)::after { content: leader(space) counter(line) }
</pre>

<p>The formatted result could be:

Wins as it wanders, dazzles where it dwells,       3
Glance o'er this page, nor to my verse deny

<p>Note that the formatter doesn't really count lines, but rather elements marked up as lines. 
</div>

<!--
<p>If the presence of a minimum length leader at the end of a line results in subsequent content being moved to the next line, the leader will also appear at the beginning of the next line. 
-->

<p>A leader is only present on one line. If the presence of a minimum length leader at the end of a line results in subsequent content being moved to the next line, the leader will also be moved to the next line. 
  
<div class="example">
<p>Consider this code:

<pre>
&lt;style>
.name::after { content: leader("...") }
&lt;/style>
&lt;div class="entry">
&lt;span class="name">Douglas Adams&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="number">43&lt;/span>
&lt;/div>
</pre>

<p>Depending on the width of the containing block, the content may or may not fit on one line. In the rendered examples below, the thrird rendition the leader and its subsequent content is moved to the second line.

<pre>
|Douglas Adams......42|
</pre>

<pre>
|Douglas Adams...42|
</pre>

<pre>
|Douglas Adams   |
|..............42|
</pre>

</div>

<p>The purpose of a leader is most often to connect two
strings visually. To achieve this, User Agents may chose to move
content appearing before the leader onto the same line as the leader. 

<div class="example">
<p>In this renditon, the User Agen has chosen to move "Adams" to the next line to preserve a visual connection:

<pre>
|Douglas         |
|Adams.........42|
</pre>
</div>


<div class="example">
<p>In cases where there is not enough space for content on both sides of the leader, the leader will remain on the same line as the following content.

<pre>
|Douglas  |
|Adams    |
|.......42|
</pre>

<pre>
|Dou|glas
|Ada|ms  
|...|42
</pre>
</div>

<div class=example>
<p>In this example, a whitespace leader is placed before a &lt;cite> element:

<pre>
&lt;style>
cite::before { content: leader('  ') }
&lt;/style>
&lt;blockquote>
  For a moment, nothing happend. 
  Then, after a second or so, 
  nothing continued to happen.
    &lt;cite>Douglas&nbsp;Adams&lt;/cite>
&lt;/blockquote>
</pre>

<p>Whitespace leaders do not connect two strings in the same way that visible leaders do. User Agents may therefore chose to not move content appearing before the leader onto the same line as the leader. This may result in a rendition like:

<pre>
|For a moment, nothing happend.  |
|Then, after a second or so,     |
|nothing continued to happen.    |
|                   Douglas Adams|
</pre>

<p>Rather than:

<pre>
|For a moment, nothing happend.  |
|Then, after a second or so,     |
|nothing continued to            |
|happen.            Douglas Adams|
</pre>

<!--
<div class="example">

  nothing continued to happen.
    &lt;cite>Douglas&nbsp;Adams&lt;/cite>

<p>Depending on the width of the containing block, this may be rendered as:

 |Then, after a second or so,     |
 |nothing continued to happen.    |
 |                   Douglas Adams|

<p>If the containing block is wider, this may be the resultant presentation:

<pre>

 |after a second or so, nothing continued |
 |to happen.                 Douglas Adams|
</pre>

</div>
-->

<p>When possible, User Agents should align corresponding glyphs from the
leaders of consecutive lines.

<div class=example>
In this example, the dotted lines are aligned horizontally so that the dots appear directly above and below each other:
<pre>
  Alfa ........ 5
  Bravo ...... 41
  Charlie ... 125
<pre>
</div>



<h2>Cross-references</h2>

<p>It is common to refer to other parts of a document by way of a
section number (e.g., "See section 3.4.1"), a page number (e.g., "See
discussion on page 72"), or a string (e.g., "See the chapter on
Europe"). This specification describes how to resolve cross-references
automatically by introducing two new values on the 'content' property.

<h3>The ''target-counter'' and ''target-counters'' values</h3>

<p>Numerical cross-references are generated by ''target-counter()''
and ''target-counters()'' values on the 'content' property that fetch the value of a counter at
the target end of the link. These functions are similar to the
''counter()'' and ''counters()'' functions, except that they fetch
counter values from remote elements. ''target-counter()'' has two
required arguments: the url of the link, and the name of a counter.
''target-counters()'' has three required arguments: the url of the
link, the name of a counter, and a separator string. Both functions
accepts an optional argument at the end that describes which list
style type to use when presenting the resulting number; ''decimal''
being the default. The syntax is defined as:

<pre>
  target-counter( <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#url-value">&lturl&gt;</a> , <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#custom-idents">&lt;custom-ident&gt;</a> [ , <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/generate.html#propdef-list-style-type">&lt;counter-style&gt;</a> ]? )
  target-counters( <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#url-value">&lturl&gt;</a> , <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#custom-idents">&lt;custom-ident&gt;</a> , <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#strings">&lt;string&gt;</a> [ , <a href=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/generate.html#propdef-list-style-type>&lt;counter-style&gt;</a> ]? )
</pre>


<div class="example">
<p>This style sheet specifies that a string like " (see page 72)"
is added after a link:

<pre>
a::after { content: "(see page " target-counter(attr(href url), page, decimal) ")" }
</pre>
</div>


<div class="example">
<p>This style sheet specifies that a string like " (see section 1.3.5)"
is added after a link:

<pre>
a::after { content: "(see section " target-counters(attr(href url), section, ".", decimal) ")" }
</pre>
</div>


<h3>The ''target-text'' value</h3>

<p>Textual cross-references are generated by ''target-text()'' which
fetches the textual content from the target end of the link. Only text
is copied; not style, structure, or replaced content.
''target-text()'' has one required argument: the url of the link. An
optional second argument specifies exactly which content is fetched.
There are four possible values: ''content'', ''before'', ''after'',
''first-letter''; these keywords are defined on 'string-set' above. The syntax is:

<pre>
  target-text( <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#url-value">&lturl&gt;</a> [, [ content | before | after | first-letter ]]? )
</pre>


<div class="example">
<p>To generate this text:

<blockquote>
<p>See Chapter 3 ("A better way") on page 31 for an in-depth evaluation.
</blockquote>

from this markup:

<pre>
&lt;p>See &lt;a href="#chx">this chapter&lt;/a> for an in-depth evaluation.
...
&lt;h2 id="chx">A better way&lt;/h2>
</pre>

this CSS code can be used:

<pre>
h2 { counter-increment: chapter }
a { content: "Chapter " target-counter(attr(href url), chapter)
   ' ("'  target-text(attr(href url), content) '") on page '
   target-counter(attr(href url), page);
</pre>
</div>


<h2>Footnotes</h2>


<div class=code-example>
<a href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/footnotes.html">html</a><br>
<a class=pass href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/footnotes-ah.pdf">AH</a>
<a class=pass href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/footnotes-pr.pdf">PR</a>
</div>


<p>When an element is turned into a footnote, certain things
happen: the element is moved to the footnote area, a footnote call is
left behind in its place, a footnote marker is displayed before the
element, and the footnote counter is incremented.

<p>A footnote is a note typically placed at the bottom of a page that
comments on, or cites, a reference. References to footnotes are marked
with a <em>footnote call</em> in the main text which corresponds to
a <em>footnote marker</em> in the <em>footnote area</em>. The
rendering of footnotes is complex. As far as possible, footnotes try
to reuse other parts of CSS. However, due to the typographic
traditions of footnotes, some new functionality is required to support
footnotes in CSS:

<ul>
<li>one new value on the 'float' property: ''footnote''
<li>one new page area: ''@footnote''
<li>two new pseudo-elements: ''::footnote-call'' and ''::footnote-marker''
<li>one predefined counter: ''footnote''
<li>one new value on the 'content' property: ''target-pull()''
<li>border segments (see <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-backgrounds-4/#border-clip">border-clip</a>)
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-css3-lists-20110524/#super-decimal">super-decimal</a>
<!--<li>two new 'list-style-type' values: ''super-decimal'', and symbol(...)-->
</ul>


<div class=example>
<p>In its simplest form, making a footnote is simple.

<pre>
&lt;style>
.footnote { float: footnote }
&lt;/style>

&lt;p>A sentence consists of words. &lt;span class="footnote">Most often.&lt;/span>.
</pre>

<p>In this example, the text <q>Most often.</q> will be placed in a
footnote. A note-call will be left behind in the main text and a
corresponding marker will be shown next to the footnote. Here is one
possible rendering:

<pre>
A sentence consists of words. &#xB9;

&#xB9; Most often.
</pre>

</div>


<!--
<div class="example remove">

<p>To support legacy browsers, it is often better to make a link to
the note rather than including the text inline. This example shows how
to fetch the content of a note and place it in a footnote.

<pre>
&lt;style>
@media print {
  .footnote {
    float: footnote;
    content: target-pull(attr(href url)) }
  .call { display: none }
}
&lt;/style>
...
&lt;p>A sentence consists of words&lt;a class="footnote" href="#words"> [3]&lt;/a>.
...
&lt;p id=words>&lt;span class="call">[3]&lt;/span> Most often.
</pre>

<p class=issue>define ''target-pull''

<p>When shown in a legacy browser, the content of the element will be
shown as a clickable link to an endnote. When printed according to
this specification, there will be a footnote:

<pre>
A sentence consists of words&#xB9;.

&#xB9; Most often.
</pre>
</div>
-->

<div class=example>
Consider this markup:
<pre>
&lt;p>Sorry, &lt;span title="This is, of course, a lie.">we're closing for lunch&lt;/span>.
</pre>

<p>The content of the "title" attribute can be turned into a footnote with this code:

<pre>
span[title]::after {
  content: attr(title);
  float: footnote;
}
</pre>
</div>


<h3>Turning elements into footnotes</h3>

<p>An element with ''float: footnote'' (called a <em>footnote
element</em>) is moved to the <em>footnote area</em> and a <em>footnote-call</em>
pseudo-element is put in its original place.

<div class="example">
<pre>
span.footnote {
  float: footnote;
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>Footnote elements are presented inside the <em>footnote area</em>,
but they inherit through their normal place in the structure of the
document.

<!--
<div class=remove>
<p>The 'display' property on footnote elements is ignored. Instead,
the value of the 'display' property in the @footnote context
determines if footnotes are block or inline elements.

<div class="example">
<p>In this example, the footnotes are displayed inline:

<pre>
@footnote {
  display: inline;
}
span.footnote {
  float: footnote;
}
</pre>

<p>Here is one possible presentation of inline footnotes:

<pre>
&#xB9; The first footnote. &#xBA; The second footnote.
</pre>
</div>

</div>
-->
<!--
<p class=issue>Another way to achieve this would be to introduce different keywords for inline and block footnotes (e.g., float: footnote-inline, float: footnote-block).
-->

<p>For each new footnote element, the ''footnote'' counter is automatically
incremented.


<h3>The footnote area</h3>

<p>All elements with ''float: footnote'' are moved to the <em>footnote
area</em>. The footnote area is described by an @footnote-rule inside
the @page-rule. By default, the footnote area appears at the bottom of
the page, but it can be positioned in other places.

<div class="example">

<p>These rules place the footnote area at the bottom of the page,
spanning all columns of the outermost multicol element:

<pre>
@page {
  @footnote {
    float: bottom;
    column-span: all;
  }
}
</pre>

<p>The code above is part of the default style sheet.
</div>


<div class="example">
<p>These rules place the footnote area at the bottom of the first column:

<pre>
@page {
  @footnote {
    float: bottom;
    column-span: none;
    width: 100%;
  }
}
</pre>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p>These rules place the footnote area at the bottom of the page, spanning all columns. Also, the footnote area is split into three columns which the footnotes are flowed into:

<pre>
@page {
  @footnote {
    float: bottom;
    column-span: all;
    columns: 3; 
  }
}
</pre>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p>This code places the footnote area at the bottom of the last column of the outermost multicol element:

<pre>
@page {
  @footnote {
    float: bottom;
    float-defer: last;
  }
}
</pre>

</div>

<p>The content of the footnote area is considered to come before other
content which may compete for the same space on the same page.

<div class="example">
<pre>
@page { @footnote { float: bottom; column-span: all }}
div.figure { float: bottom }
</pre>

<p>If figures and footnotes are on the same page, the footnotes will appear below the figures as they are floated to the bottom before the figures.
</div>


<p>Potentially, every page has a footnote area. If there
are no footnotes on the page, the footnote area will not take up any
space. If there are footnotes on a page, the layout of the footnote
area will be determined by the properties/values set on it, and by the
footnote elements inside it.

<p>These properties apply to the footnote area: 'content', 'border',
'padding', 'margin', 'height', 'width', 'max-height', 'max-width',
'min-height', 'min-width', and the background properties.

<!--
<p class="note">In published books, it is customary for the footnote
area to be limited to less than half the height of the page area. Long
footnotes may need more space, and the customary solution is for
footnotes to span several pages. To achieve this, the 'max-height'
property should be used. However, footnotes spanning several pages is
an advanced feature which is not a conformance requirement for this
specification.
-->


<div class="example">
<p>This example uses some of the applicable properties on @footnote:

<pre>
@footnote {
  margin-top: 0.5em;
  border-top: thin solid black;
  border-clip: 4em;
  padding-top: 0.5em;
}
</pre>

<p>The result of this code is a footnote area separated from other content above it by margin, border and padding. Only 4em of the border is visible due to the 'border-clip' property, which is defined in <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css4-background/">CSS Backgrounds and Borders Module Level 4</a>.   <!--[[!CSS4BACKGROUND]]-->.

</div>


<!--
<p class="issue">Footnotes in tables and floats may be problematic. In
some cases, the author may want the footnote to go at the end of the
table or float instead of the bottom of the page.
-->

<h3>Footnote calls</h3>

<p>When an element is moved to the footnote area,
a <em>footnote-call</em> is left behind. By default, User Agents must
behave as if this code is part of the default style sheet:

<pre>
::footnote-call {
  content: counter(footnote, super-decimal);
}
</pre>

<p>The resulting note call is a super-script decimal number.


<h3>Footnote markers</h3>

<p>A ::footnote-marker pseudo-element is added to each footnote
element, before <!--in the same place, and replacing, --> the ::before
pseudo-element (if any), and replacing the ::marker pseudo-element (if any). User agents must, by default, show the "footnote"
counter in the footnote-marker.

<div class="example">
<p>User Agents may display footnote-calls and footnote-markers this way by default:

<pre>
::footnote-call {
  content: counter(footnote, super-decimal);
}
::footnote-marker {
  content: counter(footnote, super-decimal);
}
</pre>
</div>

<!--
@counter-style super-decimal {
	type: numeric;
	glyphs: '\2070' '\B9' '\B2' '\B3' '\2074' '\2075' '\2076' '\2077' '\2078' '\2079';
	/* '⁰' '¹' '²' '³' '⁴' '⁵' '⁶' '⁷' '⁸' '⁹' */
}
-->

<p>Marker elements are discussed in more detail in the CSS Lists
module [CSSLIST]. One suggested change to that module is to honor
the value of 'list-style-position' on the ::footnote-marker
pseudo-element itself rather than the corresponding list-item element.
Further, one clarification to the horizontal placement of the marker
is suggested: the <em>margin</em> box of the marker box is
horizontally aligned with the start of the line box.


<h3>Counting footnotes</h3>

<p>The "footnote" counter is automatically incremented each time a
footnote is generated. That is, the "footnote" counter is incremented
by one each time an element with ''float: footnote'' appears.

<div class="example">
<p>This code adds square brackets around footnote calls and 

<pre>
::footnote-call { 
  content: " [" counter(footnote) "]";
}
</pre>
</div>


<p>The footnote counter can be reset with the 'counter-reset' property.

<div class="example">
This code resets the "footnote" counter on a per-page page basis:
<pre>
@page { counter-reset: footnote }
</pre>
</div>


<!--
<p>The 'counter-increment' property can be set in the @footnote rule.
Each time an element with 'float: footnote' is found, the corresponding
counter is incremented.

<div class="example">
<p>This rule is part of the default style sheet:

<pre>
@page {
  @footnote {
    counter-increment: footnote;
  }
}
</pre>

As a result, the "footnote" counter is incremented each time a footnote is generated.
</div>
-->

<div class=code-example>
<a href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/e-footnotes-leaders-line-numbers.html">html</a><br>
<a class=pass href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/e-footnotes-leaders-line-numbers-ah.pdf">AH</a>
<a class=pass href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/e-footnotes-leaders-line-numbers-pr.pdf">PR</a>
</div>

<div class=example>

<p>Footnotes can also be combined with other counters. In this example, a poem is shown with line numbers on the side. The "line" counter is also used in the footnoter marker. 

<pre>
@page { counter-reset: line }
div.line { counter-increment: line }
div.line:nth-of-type(2n+1)::after { content: leader(space) counter(line) }
.footnote { float: footnote }
.footnote::footnote-call { content: "" }
.footnote::footnote-marker { content: counter(line) }
</pre>

<p>The formatted result could be:

<pre>
Come, blue-eyed maid of heaven! - but thou, alas,       1
Didst never yet one mortal song inspire -
Goddess of Wisdom! here thy temple was,                 3
And is, despite of war and wasting fire,

1 From "Childe Harold's Pilgrimage" by Lord Byron
3 The use of uppercase "W" indicates great wisdom
</pre>

</div>


<h3>Laying out footnotes</h3>

<p>Footnotes must appear as early as possible under the following constraints:

<ol>

<li>A footnote marker may not appear on an earlier page than the
    footnote call.

<li>Footnotes may not appear out of document order.

<!--<span class="issue">(What order is that: the document order or the visual order?
    Probably the document order, the same order as the footnote counter
    values, although the visual order of the footnote calls may be
    different, due to their occurrence in positioned and floating
    elements.)</span>-->

<li>The footnote area is limited in size by 'max-height', unless the
    page contains only footnotes. (E.g., if at the end of the document
    there are still footnotes unprinted, the User Agent can use the whole page to
    display footnotes.)

<li>If there is a footnote call on a page, the footnote area may not
    be empty, unless its 'max-height' is too small.

</ol>

<!--
<h2>Sidenotes</h2>

<p>Sidenotes are supported the same way as footnotes; only the name
and the settings in the default style sheet differentiates the two.

<div class="example">
<p>This example moves images to the outside margin of pages:

<pre>
@page :left {
  margin-left: 10em;
  @sidenote { position: absolute; left: -8em; top: 0; width: 6em; height: auto }
}
@page :right {
  margin-right: 10em;
  @sidenote { position: absolute; right: -8em; top: 0; width: 6em; height: auto }
}
.sidenote { float: sidenote }
</pre>

<p>It is important to note that it is the sidenote area that is descibed by @sidenote, and not the elements that are floated into the sidenote area. 
</div>

-->

<h2>Named Areas</h2>

<p>The page area and footnote area are predefined areas in CSS; all content is shown in the page area by default, and footnotes can be floated to the page area. This section describes how to create other areas, how to posistion those areas, and how to fill them with content. 

<h3>Creating names areas: <code>@area</code></h3>

<p>Named areas can be generated by the style sheet to provide space for sidenotes, figures and other content which is presented apart from the main flow. Such areas are called <dfn>named areas</dfn>. The <code>@area</code> construct is used to create named areas, into which content can be floated with the <code>to()</code>.

<p>Named areas are positioned using the 'position' and 'float' properties. 

<div class="example">
<p>In this example, the sidenote area is not predefinde (as in the previous section), but defined using @area:

<pre>
@page :left {
  margin-left: 10em;
  @area sidenote { position: absolute; left: -8em; top: 0; width: 6em; height: auto }
}
@page :right {
  margin-right: 10em;
  @area sidenote { position: absolute; right: -8em; top: 0; width: 6em; height: auto }
}
.sidenote { float: to(sidenote) }
</pre>

</div>

<div class=example>
<p>In this example, images are floated to the right page, where the "photos" area take up all available space:
<pre>
@page :right {
  @area photos {
    float: top;
    width: 1vw;
    height: 1vh;
  }
}
img { float: to(photos) }
</pre>
<p>The result is a document where all content ends up on left pages, and where right pages hold only <code>img</code> elements.
</div>

<p>Areas with the same name are connected and content can flow from
one area to the next, when necessary.

<!--
<p>Elements floated to a named area are, by default, positioned at the
first available space in the named area on its natural page. If there
is no such named area on that page, or if the named area does not have
sufficient room, the element is floated to the first opportunity in
subsequent named areas with the same name. If there are no such areas,
the element is shown at the end of the document.
-->

<p>To support having several identically named areas on the same page,
a second level of @area blocks are used. Only two levels of @area are
allowed. The outer @area must always have a name, and the inner @area
must never have a name. The named areas are painted as if they
appeared in the source file after the footnote area, and before any
content.


<div class=example>
<pre>
@page {
  margin-left: 1cm 5cm;  /* wide side margins */
  @area sidenote { 
    @area { position: absolute; left: -4cm; top: 0; bottom: 0; width: 3.5cm; } /* left */
    @area { position: absolute; right: -4cm; top: 0; bottom: 0; width: 3.5cm; } /* right */
  }
}
.sidenote { float: to(sidenote) }
</pre>

<p>One possible rendering is:
<pre>
            ........ .........
            ........ .........
            ........ ...2..... second
            ........ ......... sidenote
            ........ .........
      first ....1... .........
   sidenote ........ .........
            ........ ....3.... third
            ........ ......... sidenote
            ........ .........
</pre>
<p>The digits mark the call points.
</div>


<h3>Floating content into named areas: <code>to()</code></h3>

<p>Content is added to named areas with the <code>to()</code> functional notation.

<div class=example>
<p>This code adds an element to the named area called "sidenote":

<pre>
span.note { float: to(sidenote); }
</pre>
</div>

<p>The syntax is:

<pre>
  to( <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#custom-idents">&lt;custom-ident&gt;</a> )
</pre>


<p class=issue>Is 'float' the best property to use? Could the syntax be aligned with regions? Prince uses the 'flow' property. 


<div class=code-example>
<a href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/e-leaders-line-numbers.html">html</a><br>
<a class=pass href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/e-leaders-line-numbers-ah.pdf">AH</a>
<a class=pass href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/e-leaders-line-numbers-pr.pdf">PR</a>
</div>

<div class=example>

<p>In this example, there are two streams of footnotes. The first stream is floated to the predefined "footnote" area, and the second is floated to a name area called "fn2". The first stream is referenced by line numbers, and the second by lower-alpha. 

<pre>
@page { 
  counter-reset: line 
  @area fn2 {
    float: bottom; 
    column-span: all;
    columns: 2;
  }
}
div.line { counter-increment: line }
div.line:nth-of-type(2n+1)::after { content: leader(space) counter(line) }

.footnote { float: footnote }
.footnote::footnote-call { content: "[" counter(footnote, lower-alpha) "]" }
.footnote::footnote-marker { content: "[" counter(footnote, lower-alpha) "]" }

.fn2 { float: to(fn2) }
.fn2::call { content: "" }
.fn2::marker { content: "[" counter(line) "]" }
</pre>


<p>In the formatted result, the footnote area appears below the named area.

<pre>
Come, blue-eyed maid of heaven! - but thou, alas,[a]       1
Didst never yet one mortal song inspire -
Goddess of Wisdom! here thy temple was,                    3
And is, despite of war and wasting fire,

[3] The use of uppercase "W" indicates great wisdom
[a] From "Childe Harold's Pilgrimage" by Lord Byron
</pre>

</div>


<h3>Alignment in Named Areas</h3>

<p>Content floated to a named area is, by default, aligned with its
reference point. The content will, if possible, be placed on the same
page as the reference point, and be aligned with the reference point
along both the x axis and the y axis. That is, the effect of aligning
a float to its reference point is limited to (a) choosing the page, (b)
finding the closest matching named area, and (c) starting the float on
the same baseline as the reference point.


<p>Elements may request alignments through an optional argument in <code>to()</code>. Values are:

<dl>
<dt>align
<dd>align float along both x and y axis. 

<dt>align-x
<dd>align float only along x axis

<dt>align-y
<dd>align float only along y axis

<dt>fill
<dd>do not align the float along the x/y axis, show it in the order it appears

<dt>same-page
<dd>element requests placement on the same page as its reference point. This is the default.

<dt>same-spread
<dd>element requests placement on the same spread as its reference point

</dl>

<p>A trailing "!" can be added to these keywords: align, align-x,
align-y, same-page, same-sprea. This indicates that the float should
be deleted if the exact alignment cannot be achieved.

<div class=example>

<pre>
img { float: to(sidenote) }                   /* this is the default */
img { float: to(sidenote, align same-page) }  /* this is also default */

img { float: to(sidenote, align-y }           /* float is only aligned along the y axis */
img { float: to(sidenote, fill) }             /* show float in the order they appear */
img { float: to(sidenote, fill same-spread) } /* show float in the order they appear, use any matching named flow on the spread of the reference point */
img { float: to(sidenote, same-page!) }       /* delete float if it doesn't end up on the same page */
img { float: to(sidenote, align!) }           /* delete float if it doesn't end up exactly in the requested position */
</pre>

</div>


<div class=example>

<p>In this example, the "sidenote" named area has two fragments, one
on the left side of the first column, and the other on the right side
of the second column. The respective reference points are numbered 1,
2, and 3. All three sidenotes are aligned along the x axis so that
they appear in the closest matching named area. Also, they are aligned
along the y axis so that the floats start on the same baseline as
their respective reference points.

<pre>
            ........ .........
            ........ .........
            ........ ...2..... second
            ........ ......... sidenote
            ........ .........
      first ....1... .........
   sidenote ........ .........
            ........ ....3.... third
            ........ ......... sidenote
            ........ .........
</pre>

<p>The code used to achieve this is:

<pre>
.sidenote { float: to(sidenote, align) }
</pre>

</div>


<div class=example>

<p>This example is similar to the previous one, except for the placement of the third reference point: it appears much closer to the second reference point. As a result, the second sidenote pushes down the third sidenote, which is no longer alinged along the y axis.

<pre>
            ........ .........
            ........ .........
            ........ ...2..... second
            ........ .....3... sidenote
            ........ ......... third
      first ....1... ......... sidenote
   sidenote ........ .........
            ........ ......... 
            ........ ......... 
            ........ .........
</pre>
</div>


<div class=example>

<p>In this example, floats are only aligned along the x axis:

<pre>
.sidenote { float: to(sidenote, align-x) }
</pre>

<p>As a result, floats are placed in the closest matching named
area. Inside that area, the floats are shown in the order they appear.

<pre>
      first ........ ......... second
   sidenote ........ ......... sidenote
            ........ ...2..... third
            ........ .....3... sidenote
            ........ .........
            ....1... .........
            ........ .........
            ........ ......... 
            ........ ......... 
</pre>
</div>


<div class=example>

<p>In this example, floats are not aligned with the reference point. 

<pre>
.sidenote { float: to(sidenote, fill) }
</pre>

<p>As a result, floats are placed in the first matching named area on the page of the reference point. 

<pre>
      first ........ ......... 
   sidenote ........ ......... 
     second ........ ...2..... 
   sidenote ........ ......... 
      third ........ .........
   sidenote ....1... .........
            ........ .........
            ........ ....3.... 
            ........ ......... 

</pre>
</div>

<div class=example>

<p>In this example, floats insist on being aligned with their reference point:

<pre>
.sidenote { float: to(sidenote, align!) }
</pre>

<p>However, there isn't space for the third sidenote in its preferred position. As a result, the third sidenote is deleted.

<pre>
      first ........ .........
   sidenote ........ ..2...... second
            ........ .....3... sidenote
            ........ ......... 
            ........ ......... 
            ....1... .........
            ........ .........
            ........ ......... 
</pre>
</div>




<h3>Note calls: <code>::call</code></h3>


<p>Elements that are floated to named areas can add a "call", similar to a footnote-call, at the place where they were floated from. 

<div class=example>
<pre>
.sidenote { 
  float: to(sidenote);
  counter-increment: sn;
}
.sidenote::call { 
  content: counter(sn, lower-alpha); font-size: 0.6em; vertical-align: top;
}
</pre>
</div>


<h3>Pulling content: <code>target-pull()</code></h3>

<div class=example>

<p>To support legacy browsers, it is often better to make a link to
the note rather than including the text inline. This example shows how
to fetch the content of a note and place it in a footnote.

<pre>
&lt;style>
@media print {
  .footnote {
    float: footnote;
    content: target-pull(attr(href url)) }
  .call { display: none }
}
&lt;/style>
...
&lt;p>A sentence consists of words&lt;a class="footnote" href="#words"> [3]&lt;/a>.
...
&lt;p id=words>&lt;span class="call">[3]&lt;/span> Most often.
</pre>

<p>When shown in a legacy browser, the content of the element will be
shown as a clickable link to an endnote. When printed according to
this specification, there will be a footnote:

<pre>
A sentence consists of words&#xB9;.

&#xB9; Most often.
</pre>
</div>

<div class=example>

<p>When footnotes are long or complex, it may be impractical to keep their content at the point of reference. Instead, the content of the footnote may be stored at some other point in the source file.  This example shows how to fetch the content of a note and place it in a footnote.

<pre>
&lt;style>
@media print {
  .footnote {
    float: footnote;
    content: target-pull(attr(href url)) }
}
&lt;/style>
...
&lt;p>A sentence consists of words&lt;a class="footnote" href="#words">&lt;/a>.
...
&lt;div id=words>Most often, a sentence consists of words. However, some sentences also 
  have &lt;em>numbers&lt;/em>. And punctuation, don't forget punctuation.&lt;/div>
</pre>
</div>

<h3>Fixed named areas</h3>

<p>By floating elements into a statically positioned named area, the content remains for as long as the named area is visible.

<div class=example>
<pre>
@page {
  @area sidenote { 
    position: fixed; left: -4cm; top: 0; bottom: 0; width: 3.5cm; 
  }
}
.sidenote { float: to(sidenote) }
</pre>
</div>

<p class=issue>How is the named area emptied? What is the scope?</p>




<h2>Bookmarks</h2>

<div class=code-example>
<a href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/bookmarks.html">html</a><br>
<a class=pass href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/bookmarks-ah.pdf">AH</a>
<a class=pass href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/bookmarks-pr.pdf">PR</a>
</div>

<p>Some document formats have the capability to represent bookmarks
into the document. These bookmarks can e.g. be used to show an outline
or an index of the document. Bookmarks are typically shown outside the
document itself, often in a tree-structured and clickable table of
contents. To generate bookmarks, these properties are defined:
'bookmark-level', 'bookmark-label', and 'bookmark-state'. 

<h3>'bookmark-level'</h3>

<table class=propdef>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Name:</em>
      <td><dfn>bookmark-level</dfn>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Value:</em>
      <td>none | &lt;integer>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Initial:</em>
      <td>none
    <tr>
      <td><em>Applies to:</em>
      <td>all elements
    <tr>
      <td><em>Inherited:</em>
      <td>no
    <tr>
      <td><em>Percentages:</em>
      <td>N/A
    <tr>
      <td><em>Media:</em>
      <td>all
    <tr>
      <td><em>Computed&nbsp;value:</em>
      <td>specified value
</table>

<p>This property describes what level a certain bookmark has in a
hierarchical bookmark structure. The values are:

<dl>

<dt>none

<dd>no bookmark is generated

<dt>&lt;integer>

<dd>Indicates the level of the bookmark; the highest level is ''1'', then ''2'', ''3'' etc. Zero and negative values are not allowed.

</dl>


<h3>'bookmark-label'</h3>

<table class=propdef>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Name:</em>
      <td><dfn>bookmark-label</dfn>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Value:</em>
      <td><a href="#content-list">&lt;content-list></a> | none
    <tr>
      <td><em>Initial:</em>
      <td>none
    <tr>
      <td><em>Applies to:</em>
      <td>all elements
    <tr>
      <td><em>Inherited:</em>
      <td>no
    <tr>
      <td><em>Percentages:</em>
      <td>N/A
    <tr>
      <td><em>Media:</em>
      <td>all
    <tr>
      <td><em>Computed&nbsp;value:</em>
      <td>specified value
</table>

<p>This property specifies the label of the bookmark, i.e., the text that will represent the bookmark in the bookmark structure. This properly will only be consulted if 'bookmark-level' is different from 'none'. The values are:

<dl>

<dt><a href="#content-list">&lt;content-list></a>

<dd>as defined on the 'string-set' property

<dt>none

<dd>no bookmark is generated

</dl>


<div class="example">
<p>This code would generate a simple hierachical outline of a document that uses three heading levels:

<pre>
h1 { bookmark-level: 1 }
h2 { bookmark-level: 2 }
h3 { bookmark-level: 3 }
h1, h2, h3 { bookmark-label: content() }
</pre>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p>This code will make bookmarks from links. 
<pre>
a[href] { bookmark-label: attr(href); bookmark-level: 1 }
a[title] { bookmark-label: attr(title); bookmark-level: 1 }
</pre>
<p>If a <code>title</code> attribute exisits, its value will be used as the bookmark label. Otherwisee, the URL is used. 
</div>

<div class="example">
<p>This code specififies a string to be used as the bookmark label:
<pre>
#frog { bookmark-label: "The green frog"; bookmark-level: 1 }
</pre>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p>Consider this code:
<pre>
h1 { bookmark-label: content(before) ": " content(); bookmark-level: 1 }
h1:before { content: "Chapter" }

&lt;h1>Africa&lt;/h1>
</pre>

<p>The resulting bookmark would be: "Chapter: Africa".
</div>


<h3>'bookmark-state'</h3>


<table class=propdef>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Name:</em>
      <td><dfn>bookmark-state</dfn>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Value:</em>
      <td>open | closed
    <tr>
      <td><em>Initial:</em>
      <td>open
    <tr>
      <td><em>Applies to:</em>
      <td>block-level elements
    <tr>
      <td><em>Inherited:</em>
      <td>no
    <tr>
      <td><em>Percentages:</em>
      <td>N/A
    <tr>
      <td><em>Media:</em>
      <td>all
    <tr>
      <td><em>Computed&nbsp;value:</em>
      <td>specified value
</table>

<p>A hierarchy of bookmarks may be shown in an open or closed state.
The user will typically be able to toggle the state to navigate in the
bookmarks. This property describes the initial state of a bookmark.

<div class=example>
<p>In this example, <code>h1</code> and <code>h2</code> elements are set to have an open initial bookmark stat, all other elements will be closed initially:

<pre>
* { bookmark-state: closed }
h1, h2 { bookmark-state: open }
</pre>
</div>


<h2>Page selectors</h2>

<p>In CSS2, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/page.html#page-selectors">first, left and right pages</a>, as well as named pages, can be selected. This specification adds more advanced page selectors. Page selectors are similar to normal selectors in the sense that they query a data set and select parts of it. However, page selectors and normal selector are different in what they query (normal selectors query a document tree; page selectors query a sequence of pages) and what they select (normal selectors find structured elements, page selectors find formatted pages). This specification adds two page pseudo-classes: nth() and range(). 

<h3>The <code>nth()</code> page pseudo-class</h3>

<p>The <code>nth()</code> construct is added to select a numbered page.

<div class=example>
<p>These are equivalent, they both select the first page of a document:
<pre>
@page :first { background: lime } 
@page :nth(1) { background: lime } 
</pre>
</div>

<p>The grammar of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#nth-child-pseudo">nth-child() pseudo-class</a> can be used with <code>nth()</code>:

<div class=example>
<p>In this example, pages in a document will cycle through pink, lime and white backgrounds:
<pre>
@page :nth(3n) { background: pink }
@page :nth(3n+1)) { background: lime }
@page :nth(3n+2)) { background: white }
</pre>
</div>

<h3>The <code>range()</code> page pseudo-class</h3>

<p>The :range() page pseudo-class is added to select a range of pages. The syntax is:

<pre>
  :range( S* [0-9]+ S* - S* [0-9]+ S* )
</pre>

<div class=example>
<p>In this example, page 3, 4, and 5 of the document will have a pink background. 
<pre>
@page :range(3-5) { background: pink }
</pre>
</div>


<h2>Page groups</h2>

<p>A document consists of a linear sequence of pages. In simple
documents, all pages have the same page area and marginalia. In more
complex documents, pages may have different sizes, marginalia and
orientation. Being able to style pages differently is therefore
important. Styling can be based on automatic classification (like the
pseudo-classes described in the previous section), or explicitly named
page groups. Page groups are named with the 'page' property, and
selected with a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-page/#page-type-selector">page
type selector</a>.

<div class=example>
<pre>
@page chapter { @bottom-center { content: counter(page) }
div.introduction { page: chapter }
</pre>
</div>

<p>A sequence of pages with the same name is automatically combined
into a page group. It is sometimes necessary to split one page group
into several page groups in order to, e.g., address the first page in
the group. The 'page-group' property expresses whether an element
starts a new page group or not.

<table class=propdef>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Name:</em>
      <td><dfn>page-group</dfn>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Value:</em>
    <td>auto | start 
    <tr>
      <td><em>Initial:</em>
      <td>auto
    <tr>
      <td><em>Applies to:</em>
      <td>elements with 'page' value other than auto
    <tr>
      <td><em>Inherited:</em>
      <td>no
    <tr>
      <td><em>Percentages:</em>
      <td>N/A
    <tr>
      <td><em>Media:</em>
      <td>paged
    <tr>
      <td><em>Computed&nbsp;value:</em>
      <td>as specified
</table>

<p>This property determines whether the element starts a new page group or not. 

<dl>
<dt>auto
<dd>The element only starts a new page group if 'page' has a named page different from the the previous element.

<dt>start
<dd>The element always starts a new page group.

</dl>


<div class=example>

<p>In this example, each article starts a new page group so that the first page of each article has a pink background.

<pre>
@page funky:first {
  background: pink;
}
article {
  page: funky;
  page-group: start;
}
</pre>

<p>Without the 'page-group: start' declaration, only the first page of the first article would be pink.

</div>

<p>When a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-page/#page-pseudo-class">page pseudo-class</a> is combined with a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-page/#page-type-selector">page type selector</a> (also called a "page group selector"), the page pseudo-classes query pages within that page group.

<div class=example>
<p>When used alone, ":first" selects the first page of the document. When combined with a page group selector, ":first" selects the first page in a page group

<pre>
@page :first { ...  }         /* selects the first page of the document */
@page chapter:first { ... }   /* selects the first page of every "chapter" page group */
</pre>

<p>This is similar to how the ":nth-of-type()" selector works. 
</div>

<!--
<p class=note>Another wayComplex page selectors
this is like
 :nth-of-type()
or like pseudo-elements
</p>
-->

<!--
<h3>Complex page selectors</h3>

<p>Complex page selectors are formed by combining several <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-page/#page-pseudo-class">page pseudo-classes</a>, or by combining one <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-page/#page-type-selector">page type selector</a>, called "page group selector" in this document, with one or more page pseudo-classes. 

<p>When two or more page pseudo-classes are combined into a complex page selector, it selects all pages that match all pseudo-classes. 

<div class=example>
<pre>
@page :first:nth(2) { background: lime } /* select pages that are both first and second. I.e. none */
@page :right:nth(3n) { background: lime } /* selects every third page, but only those on the right */
@page :nth(20-40):odd { ... } /* all odd pages between 20 and 40 (inclusive) */
</pre>
</div>
-->


<h2>Selecting elements within pages</h2>

<p class="XXX">This section is fairly sketchy.

<p>To select elements within a page, normal selectors can be combined with a page selector:

<div class=example>
<pre>
@page :first p { background: lime } 
@page :nth(1) .sidenote { background: lime } 
@page :nth(3n+1)) p:first-line { background: lime }
@page funky:nth(1) p { background: pink } 
</pre>
</div>

<p>The grammar is, informally: If something follows @page (with or without a space in between), it is a page selector. Between the page selector and the left curly brace comes a normal, possibly complex, selector. Elements that are (partially) shown on the selected page AND are selected by the normal selector, are selected. 

<p>In an alternative longhand syntax, selectors are placed inside an @inside-block:

<div class=example>
<p>These are identical:

<pre>
@page :left { @inside { p { text-align: left }}}
@page :left p { text-align: left }
</pre>
</div>

<p>The longhand syntax also allows the styling of elements that appear inside page areas and margin boxes.

<div class=example>
<p>In this example, two sidenote areas are declared. Paragraphs inside those areas are given a differnet styling based on which side they are in.
<pre>
@page {
  margin-left: 1cm 5cm;  /* wide side margins */

<h2>Selecting columns</h2>

div.chapter::column(3)       /* the 3rd column of the element */
div.chapter::column(2n)      /* all even columns of the element */
div.chapter::column(3+)      /* all columns but the 1st and 2nd */
div.chapter::column(2,2)     /* second column on second page */
div.chapter::column(*,2)     /* all columns on the second page */
div.chapter::column(1,*)     /* the first column on all pages */
</pre>
</div>





<h2>Baseline alignment</h2>

<p class="note">This issue has also been <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009Jan/0010.html">discussed in the past</a>. We are still searching for a solution.


<p>To avoid <em>show-through</em>, where a printed line shows through to the other side of the sheet, baselines are often aligned. Also, in multi-column layouts, lines in adjacent columns are often aligned. To achive these kinds of aligements, a flag of some kind is needed to indicate that lines within an element should be alinged. This section sketches several ideas


<h3>Idea 1</h3>

<p>One possible solution can be found in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-linebox/#line-stacking-strategy">CSS3 module: line</a>.

<div class=example>
<pre>
article { 
  columns: 3; 
  line-stacking-strategy: grid-height;
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>When <code>line-stacking-strategy</code> is set to <code>grid-height</code>, the stack height of each line is the smallest multiple of the element's <code>line-height</code> computed value that can contain the block progression of all the inline elements on that line when those elements are properly aligned. The 'line-height' property value is ignored for inline elements. 

<h3>Idea 2</h3>

<p>Another possible solution is to say: 

<ol>
<li>For each block-level element, find the "natural" set of baselines given by the computed value of 'line-height' and the used font. 
<li>When baseline alignment in turned on, each line is placed on the closest "natural" baseline.
</ol>

<p>This could be achived with:

<div class=example>
<pre>
article { 
  columns: 3; 
  line-stacking-strategy: baseline-alignment;
}
</pre>
</div>


<h3>Idea 3</h3>

<p>One problem with both Idea 1 and Idea 2 is that all content is aligned. This may not be desireable in all cases. For example, a headline will typically use a larger font size and if all lines in the headline are aligned with a "natural" baseline (or something similar), lots of white space will be generated. Therefore, we need a way to turn off baseline alignment for certain elements. 

<div class=example>

<p>In this example, the <code>article</code> element defines a set baselines to be used by its own content as well as its child elements. Child elements can opt out of the scheme by setting <code>line-stacking: normal</code> (or something):

<pre>
article { 
  columns: 3; 
  line-stacking: set-baselines;
}
article p { line-stacking: use-baselines }
article h1 { line-stacking: normal }
article img { display: block; vertical-align: bottom }
</pre>

<p>(In the code above, the 'vertical-align' property is used to declare where any extra space ends up; in this example it will end up above the image.)
</div>

<h3>Idea 4</h3>

<p>It may be possible to automatically determine which content should be excemted from baseline alignment by looking at the computed value of 'line-height'; if it matches that of the containing block, baseline alignment is turned on, otherwise it's off.

</div>

<h3>Idea 5</h3>

<p><a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-line-grid">CSS Line Grid Module</a>



<!--
<p class=note>A similar idea &mdash; 'line-stacking-strategy: grid-height' &mdash; was proposed in a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-linebox/#line-stacking-strategy">previous version of the CSS3 line module</a>. The 'line-stacking-strategy' property is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xsl/#line-stacking-strategy">used in XSL</a>.
-->


<!--
<p>In multi-column layouts, baselines are typically aligned between
adjacent columns. This gives the presentation a visual rythm, and text
in the end of the columns will be alignend. To support this, a new
value on the <span class=property>'line-box-contain'</span> property is
defined: ''line-grid'' (or, perhaps, ''gap'', ''crack'', ''snap'', ''snap-gap'', ''void'', ''grid'', ''snap-to-grid'').

<p>The value means that the height of the line in which the element
occurs should be rounded up to the smallest multiple of the used
'line-height' value on the containing block.

<div class=example>
<p>In this example, the stacking height of div.figure would be 30px (2 * 15px)

<pre>
div.multicol { line-height: 15px }
div.figure { height: 20px; line-box-contain: block inline replaced line-grid }
</pre>
</div>
-->
<!--
<p class=note>The <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-linebox/#LineStacking">line-box-contain</a> property is defined in <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-linebox">CSS3 module: line</a>.

<h2>Character substitution</h2>

<p>It is sometimes convenient to replace one character or string with another without changing the source document. The ‘text-replace’ property offers a way to perform the replacement in the style sheet.

<table class=propdef>
<tr>
  <td><em>Name:</em> 
  <td><dfn id=text-replace>text-replace</dfn>

<tr>
  <td><em>Value:</em>
  <td> [&lt;string> &lt;string>]+ | none

<tr>
  <td><em>Initial:</em>
  <td>none

<tr>
  <td><em>Applies to:</em>
  <td>all elements

<tr>
  <td><em>Inherited:</em>
  <td>yes

<tr>
  <td><em>Percentages:</em>
  <td>N/A

<tr>
  <td><em>Media:</em>
  <td>visual

<tr>
  <td><em>Computed&nbsp;value:</em>
  <td>as specified value
</table>


<p>This property replaces all occurrences of a certain string with another string in the content of the element. The property accepts pairs of strings as value, in addition to the initial 'none' value. For each pair of strings, occurrences of the first string in the content will be replaced with the second string. If 'none' is specified, no replacements will occur.

<div class=code-example>

<a href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/e-character-substitution-motivational.html">html</a><br>
<a class=fail href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/e-character-substitution-motivational-ah.pdf">AH</a>
<a class=pass href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/2013/tests/books/e-character-substitution-motivational-pr.pdf">PR</a>
</div>


<div class=example>
<p>In this example, three consecutive period characters are replaced with an ellipsis character and the apostrophe character is replaced with a quotation character:

<pre>
body { text-replace: "..." "\2026" "'" "\2019" }
</pre>

<p>As a result, the string "It's the beginning...!" will be changed to "It&#x2019;s the beginning&#x2026;!".
</div>

<div class=example>
<p>In this example, a narrow no-break space is added before exclamation marks in French texts. This is known as "quart de cadratin" in French. 

<pre>
html:lang(fr) { text-replace "!" "\202F!" }
</pre>
</div>

<!--
<div class=example>
<p>In this example, all references to &rsquo;Soviet Union' are replaced with &lsquo;<span class=property>Russia</span>&rsquo;.

<pre>
body { text-replace: "Soviet Union" "Russia" }
</pre>
</div>
-->

<p>Text replacements are applied serially; the first pair of strings is applied to the textual content of the element, then the second pair of strings is applied to the outcome etc.

<div class=example> 

<p>The two rules below yield the same result. In the first rule all 'a' characters are converted to 'b'. Subsequently, all 'b' characters are converted to 'c'. In the second rule, all 'a' and 'b' characters are converted directly to 'c'.

<pre>
body { text-replace: "a" "b" "b" "c" }
body { text-replace: "a" "c" "b" "c" }
</pre>
</div>

<p>The first string in a pair must have at least one character, while the second may be empty.

<div class=example>
<p>In this example, all 'a' characters are removed.

<pre>
body { text-replace: "a" "" }
</pre>
</div>

<p>If the first string of a pair is empty, or if an odd number of strings has been specified, the whole value is ignored and no text replacements are performed. Text replacements do not occur across element boundaries. 

<div class=example>
<p>No text replacement will occur in this example:

<pre>
h1 { text-replace: "foo" "bar" "" "foo" }   /* ignore value */
h2 { text-replace: "foo" "bar" "foobar" }   /* ignore value */
h3 { text-replace: "foobar" "barfoo" }      /* accept value, but ... */

&lt;h3>foo&lt;span>bar&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>    &lt;!-- ... start tag breaks string which would otherwise match -->
</pre>
</div>

<p>This property is evaluated after the <span class=property>content</span> property, and before <span class=property>text-transform</span>.

<h2>Microtypography</h2>

<p>Microtypography is a range of methods for improving the appearance of text. Often, small adjustments in the space between letters and words can achieve a more even presentation with less need for hyphenation and fewer widows and orphans. This specification extends two existing CSS properties &mdash; 'letter-spacing' and 'word-spacing' &mdash; with minimum and maximum values to guide User Agents when laying out text. 

<h3>Minimum, maximum and optimal spacing</h3>


<p>The 'letter-spacing' and 'word-spacing' properties are extended to accept up to three values:

<pre>
  [ normal | &lt;length> | &lt;percentage>]{1,3}
</pre>
<!-- [ normal | &lt;length> ]{1,3}-->


<p>Values are:

<dl>
<dt>normal

<dd>The spacing is the normal spacing for the current font. This value allows the user agent to alter the space between characters in order to justify text.

<dt>&lt;length>
<dd>Specifies extra spacing in addition to the default space between characters and words. Values may be negative, but there may be implementation-specific limits. 

<dt>&lt;percentage>
<dd>Relative to width of space character. 

<dd>

<p>If one value is specified, it describes the optimum value, as well as the minimum and maximum values. If two values are specified, the first denotes the optimum and the minimum, and the second denotes the maximum. If three values are specified, they describe the optimum, minimum and maximum values. 

<p>The values themselves are described in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#spacing">CSS Text</a>.

<div class=example>
<pre>
p {
  letter-spacing: -0.04em 0 0.04em;
  word-spacing: -0.2em normal 0.2em;
}
</pre>
</div>


<div class=issue>
<p>What are min/max values relative to? Are they relative to the
normal position (like the opt values are), or to the opt position?
</div>

<div class=issue>
<p>If we add percentage values, what are they relative to? Something other than em? CSS3 Text suggested advance measure/width for word-spacing, which probably means the space character?

<pre>
letter-spacing: -5% 0% 5%;
letter-spacing: -5% 0% 5%;

word-spacing: 80% 100% 120%;
word-spacing: 80% 100% 120%;
</pre>
</div>


<div class=issue>
<p>Would it be better to only use positive numbers? Like this:
<pre>
p {
  letter-spacing: 0.04em 0 0.05em;
  word-spacing: 0.2em normal 0.2em;
}
</pre>
<p>If so, one could often just use two values::
<pre>
p {
  letter-spacing: 0 0.05em;
  word-spacing: normal 0.2em;
}
</pre>

</div>

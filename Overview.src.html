<h2 class="no-num no-toc">Abstract</h2>

<p>This specification defines features often used when printing books or magazines. Using this functionality, documents written in HTML can be presented in a book-like manner, either on screen or on paper. Real books are being published with functionality described in this specification. 

<h2 class="no-num no-toc">Status</h2>

<p>This specification is in the process of establishing itself in WHATWG. As such, the term "Living Standard" indicates a goal. However, most of this specification has been interoperably implemented and is in daily use by publishers. 

<h2 class="no-num no-toc">Table of Contents</h2>

<!--toc-->


<h2 class="no-num">Goals</h2>

<p>The main goal of this specification is to enable authors to write books in HTML or other markup languages. Book publishing is a craft with long traditions and certain formatting conventions have developed over time. This specification adds functionality to CSS so that style sheets can express commonly used features in printed books, on-screen books, and page description languages.


<h2>Conformance</h2>

<p>All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are
non-normative, as are all sections explicitly marked non-normative.
Everything else in this specification is normative.

<p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", <!--"SHALL", "SHALL
NOT",--> "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this specification are to be
interpreted as described in RFC2119. For readability, these words do
not appear in all uppercase letters in this specification.
<span data-anolis-ref>RFC2119</span>

<p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps
may be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is
equivalent.

<p id="hardwareLimitations">User agents may impose
implementation-specific limits on otherwise unconstrained inputs,
e.g. to prevent denial of service attacks, to guard against running
out of memory, or to work around platform-specific limitations.



<h2>Running headers and footers</h2>

<p>To aid navigation in printed material, headers and footers are often
printed in the page margins. <span data-anolis-ref>CSSPAGE</span> describes how to place
headers and footers on a page, but not how to fetch headers and
footers from elements in the document. This specification offers two
ways to achieve this. The first mechanism is <dfn>named strings</dfn>
which <em>copies</em> the text (without style, structure, or replaced
content) from one element for later reuse in margin boxes. The second
mechanism is <dfn>running elements</dfn> which <em>moves</em> elements
(with style, structure, and replaced content) into a margin box.

<h3>Named strings</h3>

<!--
<p>Named strings are discussed both in the CSS3 Generated and Replaced
Content (section 9) and in CSS3 Paged Media (several places). For a
proposed definition of the property, one has to go back to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/06/WD-css3-page-19990623">CSS3 draft from 1999</a>
1999:
-->

<p>Named strings can be thought of as variables that can hold one
string of text each. Named strings are created with the 'string-set'
property which copies a string of text into the named string. Only
text is copied; not style, structure, or replaced content.

<div class="example">

<p>Consider this code:

<pre>
h1 { string-set: title content(text) }
</pre>

<p>Whenever an <code>h1</code> element is encountered,
its textual content is copied into a named string called
<em>title</em>. Its content can be retrieved in the 'content'
property:

<pre>
@page :right { @top-right { content: string(title) }}
</pre>

</div>



<h4>Setting named strings: the 'string-set' property</h4>

<table class=propdef>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Name:</em>
      <td><dfn>string-set</dfn>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Value:</em>
      <td>[[ &lt;identifier> &lt;content-list>] [, &lt;identifier> &lt;content-list>]* ] | none
    <tr>
      <td><em>Initial:</em>
      <td>none
    <tr>
      <td><em>Applies to:</em>
      <td>all elements
    <tr>
      <td><em>Inherited:</em>
      <td>no
    <tr>
      <td><em>Percentages:</em>
      <td>N/A
    <tr>
      <td><em>Media:</em>
      <td>all
    <tr>
      <td><em>Computed&nbsp;value:</em>
      <td>as specified value
</table>

<p>The 'string-set' property accepts a comma-separated list of named
strings. Each named string is followed by a content list that
specifies which text to copy into the named string. Whenever an
element with value of 'string-set' different from ''none'' is
encountered, the named strings are assigned their respective value.

<p>&lt;content-list> expands to one or more of these values, in any order:

<dl>

<dt>&lt;string&gt;
<dd>a string, e.g. "foo"

<dt>&lt;counter&gt;
<dd>the counter() or counters() function, as per <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#counter">CSS 2.1 section 4.3.5</a>

<!--
<dt class=remove>contents()

<dd class=remove>The textual content of the element, including the content of its ::before and ::after pseudo-element. The content of the element's descendants, including their respective ::before and ::after pseudo-elements, are included in the returned content.
-->

<dt><!--content-element-->content(text)

<dd>The textual content of the element, not including the content of its ::before and ::after pseudo-element. The content of the element's descendants, including their respective ::before and ::after pseudo-elements, are included in the returned content. This is the default value, so ''content()'' is equivalent to ''content(text)''.

<dt><!--content-before-->content(before)

<dd>The textual content of the ::before pseudo-element the content of the element.

<dt><!--content-after-->content(after)

<dd>The textual content of the ::after pseudo-element the content of the element.

<dt><!--content-first-letter-->content(first-letter)

<dd>The first letter of the content of the element. The definition of a letter is the same as for :first-letter pseudo-elements.

<!--<p class="note">The expected use for ''first-letter'' is to create one-letter headers, e.g., in dictionaries.</p>-->

</dl>

<!--
<dl class=remove>

<dt>env()

<dd>This function returns data from the local environment of the user at
the time of formatting. The function accepts one of these keywords:

<ul>
<li>env(url): returns the URL of the document
<li>env(date): returns the date on the user's system at the time of formatting
<li>env(time): returns the time on the user's system at the time of formatting
<li>env(date-time): returns the date and time on the user's system at the time of formatting
</ul>

<p>Information about date and time is formatted according to the locale of the user's system.
<p class=issue>Or, should there be a way to specify the locale? Or should we simply format all in ISO format (e.g., 2010-03-30)?

<p class=note>On many systems, preformatted strings in the user's locale can be found through the <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/strftime.html">strftime</a> function. The date, time and date-time strings can be found by using the "%x", "%X" and "%c" conversion strings, respectively.

<div class=example>

<pre>
@page {
  @top-right { content: env(url) }
  @bottom-right { content: env(date-time) }
}
</pre>

</div>
-->
</dl>

<p>Named strings can only hold the result of one assignment; whenever
a new assignment is made to a named string, its old value is replaced.

<p class='note'>User agents, however, must be able to remember the
result of more than one assignment as the ''string()'' functional value
(described below) can refer to different assignments.

<p>The scope of a named string is the page of the element to which the
'string-set' property is attached and subsequent pages.

<!--
<p>The name space of named strings is different from other sets of
names in CSS.
-->


<p>The textual content is processed as if 'white-space: normal' had been set.


<div class="example">
<pre>
h2 {
  string-set: header "Chapter " counter(header) ": " content();
  counter-increment: header;
}

&lt;h2>Europa&lt;/h2>
</pre>
<!--  string-set: header "Chapter " counter(header) ": " contents;-->

<p>Note that the string called "header" is different from the counter with the same name. The above code may result in the string called "header" is set to "Chapter 2: Europa".

</div>


<div class="example">
<p>This example results in the same value being assigned to
<em>header</em> as in the previous example. 

<pre>
h2:before { content: "Chapter " counter(header) }
h2 {
  string-set: header content(before) content(text);
  counter-increment: header }
</pre>
</div>

<div class="example">
<pre>
dt { string-set: index first-letter }
</pre>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p>The content is copied regardless of other settings on the element. In HTML, TITLE  elements are normally not displayed, but in this example the content is copied into a named string:

<pre>
title {
  display: none;
  string-set: tittel content();
}
</pre>
</div>


<h4>Using named strings</h4>

<p>The content of named strings can be recalled by using the
''string()'' value on the 'content' property. The ''string()'' value has
one required argument, namely the name of the string.

<div class="example">
<pre>
@page { @top-center { content: string(header) }}
@page { @right-middle { content: string(index) }}
@page { @top-left { content: string(entry) }}
h1 { string-set: header "Chapter " counter(chapter) content() }
dt { string-set: index first-letter, entry content() }
</pre>
<!--h1 { string-set: header "Chapter " counter(chapter) contents }
dt { string-set: index content-first-letter, entry contents }-->

</div>

<p>If the value of the named string is changed by an element on a certain
page, the named string may have several values on that page. In order to specify
which of these values should be used, an optional argument is accepted
on the ''string()'' value. This argument can have one of four keywords:

<ul>
<li>''first'': the value of the first assignment on the page is used. If there is no assignment on the page, the named string's entry value is used. The entry value is the value held by the string at the end of the previous page. ''first'' is the default value.

<li>''start'': the value of the first assignment on the page is used if the element begins the page or the named string has not been assigned a value. Otherwise, the named string's entry value is used.

<li>''last'': the named string's exit value is used

<li>''first-except'': similar to ''first'', except on the page where the value was assigned. On that page, the empty string is used.

</ul>

<p>The assignment is considered to take place on the first page where a content box representing the element occurs. If the element does not have any content boxes (e.g., if 'display: none' is set), the assignment is considered to take place on the page where the first content box would have occured if the element had been in the normal flow.

<div class="example">
<p>In this example, the first term on the page will be shown in the top left corner and the last term on the page will be shown in the top right corner. In top center of the page, the first letter of first term will be shown.
<pre>
@page { @top-left { content: string(term, first) }}
@page { @top-right { content: string(term, last) }}
@page { @top-center { content: string(index, first) }}
dt { string-set: index content(first-letter), term content(text) }
</pre>
</div>

<div class="example">

<p>Given this CSS code:

<pre>
h2 { string-set: header content() }
</pre>

<p>The value of the "header" string 

<table class=string-set-example>
<tr>
<td>page#<td>HTML code<td>first<td>start<td>last<td>first-except

...
&lt;h2>Oceania&lt;/h2>
..

</pre>
<td>Europe
<td>Europe
<td>Oceania
<td>
</table>

</div>


<div class="example">
<p>In this example, the term that is being described at the start of the page is shown in the top left header.
<pre>
@page { @top-left { content: string(term, start) }}
dt { string-set: term content() }
</pre>
</div>

<div class="example">
<pre>
@page { @top-left { content: string(term, first) }}
@page { @top-right { content: string(term, last) }}
@page { @top-center { content: string(index, first) }}
dt { string-set: index content(first-letter), term content(text) }
</pre>
</div>



<div class="example">
<p>In this example, the header in the top center will be blank on pages where 'h1' elements appear. On other pages, the string of the previous 'h1' element will be shown.
<pre>
@page { @top-center { content: string(chapter, first-except) }}
h1 { string-set: chapter content() }
</pre>
</div>

<p>If the named string referred to in a 'string()' value has not been
assigned a value, the empty string is used.


<h3>Running elements</h3>

<p>Named strings, as described above, can only hold textual content; any
style, structure or replaced content associated with the element is
ignored. To overcome this limitation, a way of moving elements into
running headers and footers is introduced.

<p>Elements that are moved into headers and footers are repeated on
several pages; they are said to be <em>running elements</em>. To
support running elements, a new value &ndash; running() &ndash; is
introduced on the 'position' property. It has one required argument:
the name by which the running element can be referred to. A running
element is not shown in its natural place; there it is treated as if
'display: none' had been set. Instead, the running element may be
displayed in a margin box.

<p>Like counters and named strings, the name of a running element is chosen by
the style sheet author, and the names have a separate name space. A
running element can hold one element, including its pseudo-elements
and its descendants. Whenever a new element is assigned to a running
element, the old element is lost.

<p class='note'>User agents, however, must be able to remember the
result of more than one assignment as the ''element()'' value
(described below) can refer to different assignments.

<p>Running elements inherit through their normal place in the
structure of the document.


<div class="example">
<pre>
title { position: running(header) }
@page { @top-center {
  content: element(header) }
}
</pre>
</div>

<!--
<div class="example remove">
<p>In this example, the element is copied into the running header but it also keeps its normal place.

<pre>
title { position: running(header), normal }
@page { @top-center {
  content: element(header) }
}
</pre>
</div>
-->


<p>Like the ''string()'' value, the ''element()'' value accepts an
optional second argument:

<dl>
<dt>''start''
<dt>''first''
<dt>''last''
<dt>''first-except''
</dl>

<p>The keywords have the same meaning as for the ''string()'' value,
and the place of the assignments are the same.

<p>The ''element()'' value cannot be combined with any other values.

<div class="example">
<p>In this example, the header is hidden from view in all media types
except print. On printed pages, the header is displayed top center on
all pages, except where h1 elements appear.

<pre>
&lt;style>
  div.header { display: none }
  @media print {
  div.header {
    display: block;
    position: running(header);
  }
  @page { @top-center { content: element(header, first-except) }}
&lt;/style>
...
&lt;div class="header">Introduction&lt;/div>
&lt;h1 class="chapter">An introduction&lt;/div>

</pre>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p>This code illustrates how to change the running header on one page in the middle of a run of pages:

<pre>
...
&lt;style>
@page { @top-center {
  content: element(header, first) }}
.header { position: running(header) }
.once { font-weight: bold }
&lt;/style>
...
&lt;div class="header">Not now&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Da di ha di da di ...
  &lt;span class="header once">NOW!&lt;/span>
  &lt;span class="header">Not now&lt;/span>
  ... da di ha di hum.&lt;/p>
...
</pre>

The header is "Not now" from the outset, due to the "div" element. The
first "span" element changes it to "<b>NOW!</b>" on the page where the
"span" element would have appeared. The second "span" element, which
would have appeared on the same page as the first is not used because the
''first'' keyword has been specified. However, the second "span"
element still sets the exit value for "header" and this value is
used on subsequent pages.
</div>



<h2>Leaders</h2>

<p>A leader is a visual pattern that guides the eye.
Typically, leaders are used to visually connect an entry in a list
with a corresponding code. For example, there are often leaders between
titles and page numbers in a table of contents (TOC). Another example is the
phone book where there are leaders between a name and a telephone
number.

<p>In CSS3, a leader is composed of series of glyphs through the
''leader()'' value on the 'content' property. The functional notation
accepts two values. The first describes the glyph pattern that makes up the
leader. These values are allowed:

<ul>
<li>leader(dotted)
<li>leader(solid)
<li>leader(space)
<li>leader(&lt;string&gt;)
</ul>

<p>Using the keyword values is equivalent to setting a string value.
The table below shows the equivalents:

<table class=border>
<tr><th>Keyword<th>String<th>Unicode characters
<tr><td>leader(dotted)<td>leader('. ')<td>\002E \0020
<tr><td>leader(solid)<td>leader('_')<td>\005F
<tr><td>leader(space)<td>leader(' ')<td>\0020
</table>


<p>User Agents should attempt to align corresponding glyphs from the
leader pattern between consecutive lines.


<p>The string inside the parenthesis is called the <em>leader string</em>.

<p>In its simplest form, the 'content' property only takes one
''leader()'' value:

<div class="example">
<pre>
heading::after { content: leader(dotted) }
</pre>
</div>

<P>The leader string must be shown in full at least once and this
establishes the minimum length of the leader. To fill the available
space, the leader string is repeated as many times as possible in the
writing direction. At the end of the leader, a partial string pattern
may be shown. White space in the leader string is collapsed according
to the values on white-space properties.

<!-- <span class="issue">Or, partial strings be avoided?</span> -->
<!--<p class="issue">Should other properties influence the appearance of leaders?-->

<p>These properties influence the appearance of leaders: all font
properties, text properties, 'letter-spacing', white-space properties,
background properties, and 'color'.

<!--
<div class=remove>

<p>The second value describes the alignment of the leader. These values are allowed:

<dl>

<dt>align

<dd>attempt to align corresponding glyphs from the  leader pattern between consecutive lines. This is the default value.

<dt>start
<dd>align leader string with the start

<dt>end
<dd>align leader string with the end

<dt>center
<dd>center leader string

<dt>string-space
<dd>add space between strings to take up all available space

<dt>letter-space
<dd>add space between letters (both inside the string, and at the start/end of the string) to take up all available space

</dl>

<div class=example>
<pre>
heading::after { content: leader(dotted, align) }
heading::after { content: leader(dotted, start) }
heading::after { content: leader(dotted, end) }
heading::after { content: leader(dotted, center) }
heading::after { content: leader(dotted, string-space) }
heading::after { content: leader(dotted, letter-space) }
</pre>
</div>

</div>
-->


<div class="example">

<p>In a more complex example, the 'leader' value is combined with other
values on the 'content' property:

<pre>
ul.toc a::after {
  content: leader(". . . ") target-counter(attr(href url), page);
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>If the content connected by a leader end up on different lines, the
leader will be present on all lines. Each leader fragment honors the
minimum length of the leader.

<div class="example">
<p>Consider this code:

<pre>
&lt;style>
.name::after { content: leader(dotted) }
&lt;/style>
&lt;div class="entry">
&lt;span class="name">John Doe&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="number">123456789&lt;/span>
&lt;/div>
</pre>

<p>If the name and number end up on different lines (e.g., in a narrow column), it may be formatted like this:

<pre>
John Doe....
...123456789
</pre>
</div>

<p>To determine the length of the leaders, user agents must do the
following for each line:

<ol>
<li>Lay out the content with leaders of minimum lengths

<li>Determine the empty space left on the line.

<li>Distribute the empty space between the leaders on the line. Glyphs
must not be shown partially. All leaders on the line should, to the
extent possible, have the same length. This may not always be possible
as the minimum leader length must be honored.

<li>Fill the empty space with the specified leader pattern.
</ol>


<div class="example">
<p>Consider this code:

<pre>
&lt;style>
cite::before { content: leader('  ') }
&lt;/style>
&lt;blockquote>
  For a moment, nothing happend. 
  Then, after a second or so, 
  nothing continued to happen.
    &lt;cite>Douglas&nbsp;Adams&lt;/cite>
&lt;/blockquote>
</pre>

<p>Depending on the width of the containing block, this may be rendered as:

<pre>
 |For a moment, nothing happend.  |
 |Then, after a second or so,     |
 |nothing continued to happen.    |
 |                   Douglas Adams|


</pre>

<!--
<p>To indicate that <q>John Johnson</q> should be kept on one line,
this rule can be added to the style sheet:

<pre>
cite { text-wrap: suppress }
</pre>

<p>Until 'text-wrap' is widely supported, this rule can also be used:

<pre>
cite { white-space: nowrap }
</pre>
-->

<p>If the containing block is wider, this may be the resultant presentation:

<pre>
 |For a moment, nothing happend. Then,    |
 |after a second or so, nothing continued |
 |to happen.                 Douglas Adams|
</pre>

</div>


<h2>Cross-references</h2>

<p>It is common to refer to other parts of a document by
way of a section number (e.g., "See section 3.4.1"), a page number
(e.g., "See discussion on page 72"), or a string (e.g., "See the
chapter on Europe"). Being able to resolve these cross-references
automatically saves time and reduces the number of errors.

<h3>The ''target-counter'' and ''target-counters'' values</h3>

<p>Numerical cross-references are generated by ''target-counter()''
and ''target-counters()'' values that fetch the value of a counter at
the target end of the link. These functions are similar to the
''counter()'' and ''counters()'' functions, except that they fetch
counter values from remote elements. ''target-counter()'' has two
required arguments: the url of the link, and the name of a counter.
''target-counters()'' has three required arguments: the url of the
link, the name of a counter, and a separator string. Both functions
accepts an optional argument at the end that describes which list
style type to use when presenting the resulting number; ''decimal''
being the default.

<div class="example">
<p>This style sheet specifies that a string like " (see page 72)"
is added after a link:

<pre>
a::after { content: "(see page " target-counter(attr(href url), page, decimal) ")" }
</pre>
</div>


<div class="example">
<p>This style sheet specifies that a string like " (see section 1.3.5)"
is added after a link:

<pre>
a::after { content: "(see section " target-counters(attr(href url), section, ".", decimal) ")" }
</pre>
</div>


<h3>The ''target-text'' value</h3>

<p>Textual cross-references are generated by ''target-text()'' which
fetches the textual content from the target end of the link. Only text
is copied; not style, structure, or replaced content.
''target-text()'' has one required argument: the url of the link. An
optional second argument specifies exactly which content is fetched.
There are four possible values: <!--''contents'',--> ''content'',
''before'', ''after'', ''first-letter''; these
keywords are defined above.


<div class="example">
<p>To generate this text:

<blockquote>
<p>See Chapter 3 ("A better way") on page 31 for an in-depth evaluation.
</blockquote>

from this markup:

<pre>
&lt;p>See &lt;a href="#chx">this chapter&lt;/a> for an in-depth evaluation.
...
&lt;h2 id="chx">A better way&lt;/h2>
</pre>

this CSS code can be used:

<pre>
h2 { counter-increment: chapter }
a { content: "Chapter " target-counter(attr(href url), chapter)
   ' ("'  target-text(attr(href url), content) '") on page '
   target-counter(attr(href url), page);
</pre>
</div>


<h2>Footnotes</h2>

<p>When an element is turned into a footnote, certain things
happen: the element is moved to the footnote area, a footnote call is
left behind in its place, a footnote marker is displayed before the
element, and the footnote counter is incremented.

<p>A footnote is a note typically placed at the bottom of a page that
comments on, or cites, a reference. References to footnotes are marked
with a <em>footnote call</em> in the main text which corresponds to
a <em>footnote marker</em> in the <em>footnote area</em>. The
rendering of footnotes is complex. As far as possible, footnotes try
to reuse other parts of CSS. However, due to the typographic
traditions of footnotes, some new functionality is required to support
footnotes in CSS:

<ul>
<li>one new value on the 'float' property: ''footnote''
<li>one new page area: ''@footnote''
<li>two new pseudo-elements: ''::footnote-call'' and ''::footnote-marker''
<li>one predefined counter: ''footnote''
<li class=remove>one new value on the 'content' property: ''target-pull()''
<li>border segments (see <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-backgrounds-4/#border-clip">border-clip</a>)
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-css3-lists-20110524/#super-decimal">super-decimal</a>
<!--<li>two new 'list-style-type' values: ''super-decimal'', and symbol(...)-->
</ul>


<div class=example>
<p>In its simplest form, making a footnote is simple.

<pre>
&lt;style>
.footnote { float: footnote }
&lt;/style>

&lt;p>A sentence consists of words. &lt;span class="footnote">Most often.&lt;/span>.
</pre>

<p>In this example, the text <q>Most often.</q> will be placed in a
footnote. A note-call will be left behind in the main text and a
corresponding marker will be shown next to the footnote. Here is one
possible rendering:

<pre>
A sentence consists of words. &#xB9;

&#xB9; Most often.
</pre>

</div>


<!--
<div class="example remove">

<p>To support legacy browsers, it is often better to make a link to
the note rather than including the text inline. This example shows how
to fetch the content of a note and place it in a footnote.

<pre>
&lt;style>
@media print {
  .footnote {
    float: footnote;
    content: target-pull(attr(href url)) }
  .call { display: none }
}
&lt;/style>
...
&lt;p>A sentence consists of words&lt;a class="footnote" href="#words"> [3]&lt;/a>.
...
&lt;p id=words>&lt;span class="call">[3]&lt;/span> Most often.
</pre>

<p class=issue>define ''target-pull''

<p>When shown in a legacy browser, the content of the element will be
shown as a clickable link to an endnote. When printed according to
this specification, there will be a footnote:

<pre>
A sentence consists of words&#xB9;.

&#xB9; Most often.
</pre>
</div>
-->

<div class=example>
Consider this markup:
<pre>
&lt;p>Sorry, &lt;span title="This is, of course, a lie.">we're closing for lunch&lt;/span>.
</pre>

<p>The content of the "title" attribute can be turned into a footnote with this code:

<pre>
span[title]::after {
  content: attr(title);
  float: footnote;
}
</pre>
</div>


<h3>Turning elements into footnotes</h3>

<p>An element with ''float: footnote'' (called a <em>footnote
element</em>) is moved to the <em>footnote area</em> and a <em>footnote-call</em>
pseudo-element is put in its original place.

<div class="example">
<pre>
span.footnote {
  float: footnote;
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>Footnote elements are presented inside the <em>footnote area</em>,
but they inherit through their normal place in the structure of the
document.

<!--
<div class=remove>
<p>The 'display' property on footnote elements is ignored. Instead,
the value of the 'display' property in the @footnote context
determines if footnotes are block or inline elements.

<div class="example">
<p>In this example, the footnotes are displayed inline:

<pre>
@footnote {
  display: inline;
}
span.footnote {
  float: footnote;
}
</pre>

<p>Here is one possible presentation of inline footnotes:

<pre>
&#xB9; The first footnote. &#xBA; The second footnote.
</pre>
</div>

</div>
-->
<!--
<p class=issue>Another way to achieve this would be to introduce different keywords for inline and block footnotes (e.g., float: footnote-inline, float: footnote-block).
-->

<p>For each new footnote element, the ''footnote'' counter is automatically
incremented.


<h3>The footnote area</h3>

<p>All elements with ''float: footnote'' are moved to the <em>footnote
area</em>. The footnote area is described by an @footnote-rule inside
the @page-rule. By default, the footnote area appears at the bottom of
the page, but it can be positioned in other places.

<p class=XXX>Should the footnote are be positioned using page floats or (fixed?) absolute positioning? Or both?

<div class="example">

<p>These rules place the footnote area at the bottom of the page, spanning all columns:

<pre>
@page {
  @footnote {
    float: bottom;
    column-span: all;
    width: 100%;
  }
}
</pre>
</div>



<div class="example">
<p>These rules place the footnote area at the bottom of the first column:

<pre>
@page {
  @footnote {
    float: bottom;
    width: 100%;
  }
}
</pre>
</div>


<div class="example XXX">
<p>This code places the footnote area at the bottom of the right column:

<pre>
@page {
  @footnote {
    float: bottom-corner;
    width: 100%;
  }
}
</pre>

</div>

<!--
<p class=issue>How should one indicate that the footnote area should
span columns? Typically, footnotes are put inside columns rather than
spanning the full width, but there could be exceptions.
-->

<p>The content of the footnote area is considered to come before other
content which may compete for the same space on the same page.

<div class="example">
<pre>
@page { @footnote { float: bottom page}}
div.figure { float: bottom page }
</pre>

<p>If figures and footnotes are on the same page, the footnotes will appear below the figures as they are floated to the bottom before the figures.
</div>


<p>Potentially, every page has a footnote area. If there
are no footnotes on the page, the footnote area will not take up any
space. If there are footnotes on a page, the layout of the footnote
area will be determined by the properties/values set on it, and by the
footnote elements elements inside it.

<p>These properties apply to the footnote area: 'content', 'border',
'padding', 'margin', 'height', 'width', 'max-height', 'max-width',
'min-height', 'min-width', the background properties.

<!--
<p class="note">In published books, it is customary for the footnote
area to be limited to less than half the height of the page area. Long
footnotes may need more space, and the customary solution is for
footnotes to span several pages. To achieve this, the 'max-height'
property should be used. However, footnotes spanning several pages is
an advanced feature which is not a conformance requirement for this
specification.
-->


<div class="example">
<p>This example uses some of the applicable properties on @footnote:

<pre>
@footnote {
  margin-top: 0.5em;
  border-top: thin solid black;
  border-clip: 4em;
  padding-top: 0.5em;
}
</pre>

<p>The result of this code is a footnote area separated from other content above it by margin, border and padding. Only 4em of the border is visible due to the 'border-clip' property, which is defined in <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css4-background/">CSS Backgrounds and Borders Module Level 4</a>.   <!--[[!CSS4BACKGROUND]]-->.

</div>




<!--
<p class="issue">Footnotes in tables and floats may be problematic. In
some cases, the author may want the footnote to go at the end of the
table or float instead of the bottom of the page.
-->

<h3>Footnote calls</h3>

<p>When an element is moved to the footnote area,
a <em>footnote-call</em> is left behind. By default, User Agents must
behave as if this code is part of the default style sheet:

<pre>
::footnote-call {
  content: counter(footnote, super-decimal);
}
</pre>

<p>The resulting note call is a super-script decimal number.


<h3>Footnote markers</h3>

<p>A ::footnote-marker pseudo-element is added to each footnote
element, in the same place, and replacing, the ::before
pseudo-element. User agents must, by default, show the "footnote"
counter in the footnote-marker.

<div class="example">
<p>User Agents may display footnote-calls and footnote-markers this way by default:

<pre>
::footnote-call {
  content: counter(footnote, super-decimal);
}
::footnote-marker {
  content: counter(footnote, super-decimal);
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>Marker elements are discussed in more detail in the CSS Lists
module [CSSLIST]. One suggested change to that module is to honor
the value of 'list-style-position' on the ::footnote-marker
pseudo-element itself rather than the corresponding list-item element.
Further, one clarification to the horizontal placement of the marker
is suggested: the <em>margin</em> box of the marker box is
horizontally aligned with the start of the line box.


<h3>Counting footnotes</h3>

<p>The "footnote" counter is automatically incremented each time a
footnote is generated. That is, the "footnote" counter is incremented
by one each time an element with ''float: footnote'' appears.

<p>The footnote counter can be reset with the 'counter-reset' property.

<div class="example">
This code resets the "footnote" counter on a per-page page basis:
<pre>
@page { counter-reset: footnote }
</pre>
</div>

<p class=XXX>Should one also be able to manually increment the "footnote" counter?

<!--
<p>The 'counter-increment' property can be set in the @footnote rule.
Each time an element with 'float: footnote' is found, the corresponding
counter is incremented.

<div class="example">
<p>This rule is part of the default style sheet:

<pre>
@page {
  @footnote {
    counter-increment: footnote;
  }
}
</pre>

As a result, the "footnote" counter is incremented each time a footnote is generated.
</div>
-->




<h3>Laying out footnotes</h3>

<p>Footnotes must appear as early as possible under the following constraints:

<ol>

<li>A footnote marker may not appear on an earlier page than the
    footnote call.

<li>Footnotes may not appear out of document order.

<!--<span class="issue">(What order is that: the document order or the visual order?
    Probably the document order, the same order as the footnote counter
    values, although the visual order of the footnote calls may be
    different, due to their occurrence in positioned and floating
    elements.)</span>-->

<li>The footnote area is limited in size by 'max-height', unless the
    page contains only footnotes. (E.g., if at the end of the document
    there are still footnotes unprinted, the User Agent can use the whole page to
    display footnotes.)

<li>If there is a footnote call on a page, the footnote area may not
    be empty, unless its 'max-height' is too small.

</ol>

<!--
<h3>Footnote magic</h3>

<p>When an element is turned into a footnote, certain magical things
happen. The element is moved to the footnote area, a footnote call is
left behind in its place, a footnote marker is displayed before the
element, and the footnote counter is incremented.

<p>When rendering footnotes, User Agents may apply certain heuristics
to improve the presentation. For example, the space between a
footnote-call and surrounding text may be adjusted. Another example is
the height of the footnote area; it may be heuristically constrained
to limit the area that is used for footnotes.
-->


<h2>Sidenotes</h2>

<p>Sidenotes are supported the same way as footnotes; only the name
and the settings in the default style sheet differentiates the two.

<div class="example">
<p>This example moves images to the outside margin of pages:

<pre>
@page :left {
  margin-left: 10em;
  @sidenote { position: fixed; left: -8em; width: 6em }
}
@page :right {
  margin-right: 10em;
  @sidenote { position: fixed; right: -8em; width: 6em }
}
img { float: sidenote }
</pre>

<p>It is important to note that it is the sidenote area that is descibed by @sidenote, and not the elements that are floated into the sidenote area. 
</div>


<p class=XXX>Should there be a mechanism to create new areas like
footnote/sidenote, or are two predefinded areas enough?

<!--
<p>Hyphenation means splitting words to improve the layout of
paragraphs. This specifications does not define the exact rules for
hyphenation, but describes six properties that influence hyphenation.

<h3>The 'hyphens' property</h3>

<table class=propdef>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Name:</em>
      <td><dfn>hyphens</dfn>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Value:</em>
      <td>none | manual | auto | all
    <tr>
      <td><em>Initial:</em>
      <td>manual
    <tr>
      <td><em>Applies to:</em>
      <td>all elements
    <tr>
      <td><em>Inherited:</em>

      <td><em>Media:</em>
      <td>visual
    <tr>
      <td><em>Computed&nbsp;value:</em>
      <td>specified value
</table>

<p>Values are:

<dl>
<dt>none

<dd>Words are not broken at line breaks, even if characters inside the word suggest line break points.

<dt>manual

<dd>Words are only broken at line breaks where there are characters inside the word that suggest line break opportunities. Characters can be explicit or conditional.

<div class="example">
<p>In Unicode, U+00AD is a conditional "soft hyphen" and U+2010 is an explicit hyphen. Unicode Standard Annex #14 describes the <a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr14/#SoftHyphen">role of soft hyphens in the</a> Unicode Line breaking algorithm.
</div>

<div class="example">
<p>In HTML, &amp;shy; represents the soft hyphen character which suggests a line break opportunity.
<pre>
ex&amp;shy;ample.
</pre>
</div>


<dt>auto
<dd>Words can be broken at appropriate hyphenation points, as determined by characters inside the word, resources listed in 'hyphenate-resource', or other UA-dependent resources. Characters inside the word take priority over hyphenation points determined by other resources.

<dt>all

<dd>All possible hyphenation points, as determined by characters inside the word, resources listed in 'hyphenate-resource', or other UA-dependent resources, are marked. The visual appearance of the mark is UA-dependent.


</dl>

<h3>The 'hyphenate-resource' property</h3>

<table class=propdef>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Name:</em>
      <td><dfn>hyphenate-resource</dfn>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Value:</em>

      <td><em>Media:</em>
      <td>visual
    <tr>
      <td><em>Computed&nbsp;value:</em>
      <td>specified value
</table>

<p>This property specifies a comma-separated list of external resources that can help the UA determine hyphenation points. If more than one resource is specified, the UA should consult each resource &ndash; in turn, from the beginning &ndash; until it finds one that is able to determine hyphenation points in a word. The 'none' value indicates that no external resources are available. In any case, the UA can also use local resources not listed on this property.

<div class="example">

<p>Often, finding the right hyphenate resource is based on knowing the
language of the text. The <code>lang</code> attribute is recommended
for encoding the language, and the corresponding selector is used in
this example:

<pre>
:lang(dk) { hyphenate-resource: url("hyph_da_DK.dic"), url("hyph_da_NO.dic") }
</pre>

</div>

<h3>The 'hyphenate-before' and 'hyphenate-after' properties</h3>

<p>This property specifies the minimum number of characters in a
hyphenated word before the hyphenation character. The ''auto'' value
means that the UA chooses a value that adapts to the current layout.

<p class="note">Unless the UA is able to calculate a better value, it
is suggested that ''auto'' means 2.

<h3>The 'hyphenate-lines' property</h3>

<table class=propdef>
    <tr>

      <td>visual
    <tr>
      <td><em>Computed&nbsp;value:</em>
      <td>specified value
</table>

<p>This property indicates the maximum number of successive hyphenated
lines in an element. In some cases, user agents may not be able to
honor the specified value. The ''no-limit'' value means that there is
no limit.

<h3>The 'hyphenate-character' property</h3>

<table class=propdef>

      <td>visual
    <tr>
      <td><em>Computed&nbsp;value:</em>
      <td>specified value
</table>

<p>This property specifies strings that are shown between parts of
hyphenated words. The 'auto' value means that the user agent should
find an appropriate value.

<div class="example">
<p>In Latin scripts, the hyphen character (U+2010) is often used to
indicate that a word has been split. Normally, it will not be
necessary to set it explicitly. However, this can easily be done:

      <td>visual
    <tr>
      <td><em>Computed&nbsp;value:</em>
      <td>specified value
</table>

<p>This property indicates hyphenation behavior at the end of elements, column, pages and spreads. A spread is a set of two pages that are visible to the reader at the same time. Values are:

<dl>
<dt>auto

<dd>no restrictions imposed

<dt>always

<dd>the last full line of the element, or the last line before any column, page, or spread break inside the element should not be hyphenated.

<dt>column

<dd>the last line before any column, page, or spread break inside the element should not be hyphenated

<dt>page

<dd>the last line before page or spread break inside the element should not be hyphenated

<dt>spread

<dd>the last line before any spread break inside the element should not be hyphenated.

</dl>

<div class=example>
<pre>
p { hyphenate-last-line-avoid: always }
div.chapter {  hyphenate-last-line-avoid: spread }

<h2>New counter styles</h2>


<h3>The ''super-decimal'' list-style-type</h3>

<p class=issue>This section will be moved to css3-lists (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009Jun/0186.html">minutes</a>)

<p>A new list-style-type, ''super-decimal'', is introduced to better support
footnotes. Small, super-script footnote calls are common; the first
three numbers have code points in Latin-1 and some font families have
even more super-script glyphs. The ''super-decimal'' keyword allow
these font resources to be used and replaces the use of 'font-size'
and 'vertical-align' (which prohibit the use of special-purpose
glyphs).

<div class="example">
This example specifies that footnote markers should consist of
super-script decimal numbers.

<pre>
::footnote-marker { content: counter(footnote, super-decimal) }

<h3>Named counter styles</h3>

<p>CSS defines a number of predefined list style types for the
'list-style-type' property and other places where a list-style-type
value is accepted. Some styles repeat the same glyph (e.g., ''disc''
and ''circle'') while others have lists of glyphs (e.g., ''decimal'',
and ''lower-roman''). To increase the range of lists that can be
achieved through CSS without adding many new keywords,
@counter-style rules are introduced. By using @counter-style, a style
sheet can name new counter styles.

<p>An @counter-style rule consists of the keyword ''@counter-style'',
followed by the name of the symbol counter style, followed by a
space-separated list of strings.

<div class="example">

<pre>
@counter-style daggers "*" "\2020" "\2021" "\A7" "#";
ol { list-style-type: daggers }
</pre>

</div>

<div class="example">

<pre>
@counter-style ordinal "1st" "2nd" "3rd" "4th";
h1:before { content: counter(chapter, ordinal) " chapter" }
</pre>

</div>

<p>The first string in the list represents number one, the second
string represents number two, etc. Outside the range of specified values, the rendering
will be as if the ''decimal'' list style type had been specified.

<div class="example">
<p>Consider this example:

<pre>
@counter-style ordinal "1st" "2nd" "3rd" "4th";
ordered-list { counter-reset: items -1 }
list-item { counter-increment: items 2 }
</pre>

<p>For a series of <tt>list-item</tt> elements inside an
<tt>ordered-list</tt> element, the value of the <tt>items</tt> counter
will be -1, 1, 3, 5, 7 etc. Given that the <tt>ordinal</tt> counter
style only defines a counter style for 1, 2, 3, and 4, the list will
be numbered "-1", "1st", "3rd", "5", "7" etc.

</div>

<p>Named counter styles can be imported through @import statements.

<div class="example">
<pre>
@import url(http://www.example.com/armenian-counters.css); /* defines 'armenian' */
ol { list-style-type: armenian }
</pre>
</div>
-->

<!--
<div class="issue">Should we allow images in addition to strings?
<pre>
  @counter-style graphic url("1.gif") url("2.gif") url("3.gif")
</pre>
</div>
-->
<!--
<h3>The ''symbols()'' list-style-type</h3>

<p>A new list-style-type with a functional notation is introduced to
avoid the indirection of having to name counter styles. The
''symbols()'' value takes a comma-separated list of strings as
arguments.


<div class="example">
<pre>
::footnote-call {
    content: counter(footnote, symbols('*', '+', '!'))
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>Outside the range of specified values, the rendering will be as if
the ''decimal'' list style type had been specified.

<div class="example">

This code:

<pre>
ol { list-style: symbols("*", "\2020", "\2021", "\A7", "#") }
</pre>

will result in these list-items markers: * &#x2020; &#x2021; &#xA7; # 6 7 8 ...

</div>

<!--
<p class="issue">Should there be a way to indicate the behavior if there are more items than strings? Proposals include: "alphabetic", "enumerate", "numeric", "cycle", "ideographic".

<h2>Page counters</h2>

<p>Printed publications often show page numbers to indicate the
sequence of papes. Also, it is common to show the total number of
pages in the document. For example, "page 3 of 5" may be shown at the
bottom of a page.

<p>This specifiction describes two counters that can be used to
indicate page numbers: ''page'' and ''pages''.

<h3>The ''page'' counter</h3>

<p>The ''page'' counter is predefined to start with a value of zero,
and to be automatically incremented by one before every page. That is,
UAs must behave as if this code fragment is part of the default style
sheet:

<pre>
@page {
  counter-increment: page 1;
}
</pre>

<p>The ''page'' counter can be reset and incremented in style sheets
just like other counters. On pages where the counter is incremented by
the style sheet in the page context, the automatic incrementation does
not take place.

<div class="example">

<pre>
@page {
  @bottom-center {
     content: counter(page);
  }
}

@page introduction {
  counter-reset: page;
}

@page :right {
  counter-increment: page 2;
}
</pre>
</div>


<h3>The ''pages'' counter</h3>

<p>The ''pages'' counter is predefined to have the total number of
pages in the document. In order to find the value of this counter, the
UA will have to paginate the document. This counter is a constant and
it cannot be set or incremented by a style sheet.

<div class=example>
<pre>
@page {
  @bottom-center {
     content: "Page " counter(page) " of " counter(pages) " pages in total";
  }
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>UAs that are not able to paginate the document should display a
question mark or another symbol that indicates uncertainty.

<div class=example>

<p>This code has no effect on the ''pages'' counter which cannot be
changed by the style sheet. However, the the ''page'' counter reset normally.

<pre>
@page :right {
  counter-reset: pages page;
}
</pre>
</div>

<h2>Image resolution</h2>

<p>Image resolution, as the term is used in this document, means
pixels per physical length, e.g., pixels per inch. Some image formats
can record information about the resolution of images. This
information can be helpful when determining the actual size of the
image in the formatting process. However, the information can also be
wrong, in which case it should be ignored. The 'image-resolution' and
'background-image-resolution' properties are introduced to determine
the correct resolution of images.

<table class=propdef>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Name:</em>
      <td><dfn>image-resolution</dfn>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Value:</em>
    <td>normal | [ from-image || &lt;dpi> ]

      <td><em>Initial:</em>
      <td>normal

    <tr>
      <td><em>Computed&nbsp;value:</em>
      <td>as specified value <span class=issue>(or, should it be only one value?)</span>
</table>

<p>The values are:

<dl>
<dt>normal

<dd>The resolution of the image is unknown, and UAs should not use the
resolution found in the image. Instead, the image resolution will be
found by converting the dimension of the image into CSS pixels.

<dt>from-image

<dd>The UA must look for the resolution in the image itself. If the image does not have a resolution, the specified &lt;dpi> value is used. If no &lt;dpi> value is specified, the behavior is as if ''normal'' had been specified.

<dt>&lt;dpi>

<dd>The value consists of a number with a 'dpi' unit identifier. The &lt;dpi> value sets the resolution of the image. In combination with ''from-image'', the specified dpi is only used if the image does not have a resolution.

</dl>

<div class="example">
<p>This rule specifies that the UA should use the image resolution found in the image itself.
<pre>

list of two values. The values are:

found by making image pixels equivalent to CSS pixels.

<dt>auto

<dt>&lt;dpi>

<dd>The value consists of a number with a 'dpi' unit identifier. The
UA should use the specified resolution.

</dl>

<p>If, after evaluating the specified values, no image resolution has been determined, the UA should behave as if ''normal'' had been specified.

<h2>Page marks and bleed area</h2>

<h2>Bookmarks</h2>

<p>Some document formats have the capability to represent bookmarks
into the document. These bookmarks can e.g. be used to show an outline
or an index of the document. Bookmarks are typically shown outside the
document itself, often in a tree-structured and clickable table of
contents. To generate bookmarks, these properties are defined:
'bookmark-level', 'bookmark-label', and 'bookmark-state'. 

<h3>'bookmark-level'</h3>

<table class=propdef>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Name:</em>
      <td><dfn>bookmark-level</dfn>
    <tr>

    <tr>
      <td><em>Computed&nbsp;value:</em>
      <td>specified value
</table>

<p>This property describes what level a certain bookmark has in a
hierarchical bookmark structure. The values are:

<dl>

<dt>none

<dd>no bookmark is generated

<dt>&lt;integer>

<dd>Indicates the level of the bookmark; the highest level is ''1'', then ''2'', ''3'' etc. Zero and negative values are not allowed.

</dl>


<h3>'bookmark-label'</h3>

<table class=propdef>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Name:</em>

<dt>&lt;content-list>

<dd>as defined on the 'string-set' property

<dt>none

<dd>no bookmark is generated

</dl>

h1 { bookmark-level: 1 }
h2 { bookmark-level: 2 }
h3 { bookmark-level: 3 }
h1, h2, h3 { bookmark-label: content() }

<h2>CMYK colors</h2>

<div class="note">
<p>There is a plan in place to move this section to [[CSS4COLOR]].
</div>


<p>Printers do not use RGB colors, they (often) use CMYK: cyan,
magenta, yellow and black. The ''device-cmyk()'' functional value allows
style sheets to express device-dependent CMYK colors.

<div class="example">
<pre>
h3 { color: device-cmyk(0.8, 0.5, 0.0, 0.3) }
</pre>
</div>

<p>The values representing the colors are between ''0'' and ''1''.
Values outside this range are clipped.

<p>It is not expected that screen-centric user agents support CMYK
colors and it is therefore important that existing CSS color values can
be combined with CMYK colors.

<div class="example">
<pre>
h3 {
  color: red;
  color: device-cmyk(0.5, 0.1, 0.0, 0.2);
}
</pre>

<p>User Agents that do not understand the <code>device-cmyk()</code> value, will use the first color (red). User agents that understand <code>device-cmyk()</code> will use the second color (which is bluish).

<h2>Paged presentations</h2>

<div class="note">
<p>There is a plan in place to move this section to [[CSSOVERFLOW3]].
</div>


<p>Printed publications are paged, while screen-based presentations of web pages are most often presented in a continous manner with a scrollbar on the side. There are reasons to believe that screen-based presentations also could benefit from using paged presentations. There is nothing in web specifications that prevent browsers from adding a page-based mode today. However, most web content is authored and styled with a continous presentation in mind. This could change if it becomes possible to describe paged presentations in style sheets. This section is an attempt to do so.

<p>To support paged presentations, four new values are added to the 'overflow-style' property:

<dl>
<dt>paged-x

<dd>overflow content is paged, and the pages are laid out along the x axis, in the x axis component of the writing direction

<dt>paged-y

<dd>overflow content is paged, and the pages are laid out along the y axis, in the the y axis component of the writing direction

<dt>paged-x-controls

<dd>as 'paged-x', but with added UA-specific controls to change pages

<dt>paged-y-controls

<dd>as 'paged-y', but with added UA-specific controls to change pages

</dl>


<p class=issue>Is "paginated" a better word?
<p class=issue>Should controls be specified on a separate property, or on an attribute (like HTML's video element)?
<p class=issue>Should the axis (x/y) be specified on a separate property?


<div class=example>
<p>In this example, the root element is constrained to have the same
height as the initial containing block. Overflow content will be laid
out on subsequent pages along the x axis. In LTR languages, this means
right; in RTL languages this means left; in vertical-rl this means
right.

<pre>
  html {
    overflow-style: paged-x;
    height: 100%;
  }
</pre>
</div>

<div class=example>
<p>In this example, one element within the document is paged, and
controls are added so that users can navigate from one page to the
next. As such, the controls have the same effect as scrollbars in
continous presentations.

<pre>
  #content {
    overflow-style: paged-x-controls;
    height: 400px;
  }
</pre>
</div>

<p>A paged container cannot be split over multiple columns.

<h2>Spatial layout of pages; @layout</h2>

<div class="note">
<p>There is a plan in place to move this section to [[CSSOVERFLOW3]].
</div>


<p>In commonly used apps, pages are often laid out spatially so that
users can nagivate from one page to another by moving up, down, right
or left. To support this feature for web content, a new @-rule is
proposed: @layout. The purpose of @layout is to describe how pages are
laid out spatially relative to the current document.

<p>Four new properties are allowed inside @layout: nav-up, nav-right, nav-bottom, nav-right. 

<p class=note>The name of the properties inside @navigation are borrowed from <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/CR-css3-ui-20040511/#nav-dir">CSS3 Basic User Interface Module</a>.

<p>The properties accept these values:

<dl>

<dt>go()

<dd>the function takes one argument, which refers to the <tt>rel</tt> attribute of the <tt>link</tt> element

<div class=example>
<pre>
&lt;link rel=index href="../index.html">
&lt;link rel=previous href=g3.html>
&lt;link rel=next href=g1.html>
...

@layout {
  nav-up: go(index); 
  nav-left: go(previous); 
  nav-right: go(next); 
}
</pre>
</div>

<p class=issue>This functionality relies on semantics in HTML and CSS. Other languages may have other other ways to describe such semantics. One possible solution for other languages is  "link[rel=index] { nav-up: attr(href) }"

<dt>''back''

<dd>The keyword takes the user one step back in the history of browsed pages.

<div class=example>
<pre>
@navigation {
  nav-left: back;
}
</pre>
</div>

<dt>url()

<dd>The funcation takes one argument: a URL. Relative URLs are
relative to the style sheet.

<div class=example>
<pre>
@layout {
  nav-up: url(..);
  nav-down: url(a1.html);
}
</pre>
</div>

<dt>url-doc()

<dd>The function is identical to url(), except that relative URLs are
relative to the document, not to the style sheet.

<div class=example>
<pre>
@layout {
  nav-up: url-doc(..);
  nav-down: url-doc(a1.html);
}
</pre>
</div>

</dl>



<div class=example>

<p>Combined with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-css3-conditional-20110901/#at-document">@document-rule</a>, navigation maps can be described:

<pre>
@document url("http://example.com/foo") {
  @layout {
    nav-right: link-rel(next);
  }
}

@document url("http://example.com/bar") {
  @layout {
    nav-up: link-rel(next);
  }
}
</pre>

</div>


<h3>Page shift effects</h3>

<p>To describe page shift effects, four new properties inside
@navigation are proposed: nav-up-shift, nav-right-shift,
nav-down-shift, nav-left-shift. These properties take one of several
keyword values:

<dl>

<dt>pan
<dd>pans to the new page; this is the initial value

<dt>turn
<dd>turns the page, like soft book pages do

<dt>flip
<dd>flips the page, like stiff cardbord

<dt>fold
<dd>the old page folds, like an accordion

</dl>

<p class=issue>The proposed keyword values are loosely described. Are
there better ways to describe transitions?

<div class=example>
<pre>
@navigation {
   nav-up-shift: pan;
   nav-down-shift: flip;
}
</pre>
</div>

<h2>Page floats</h2>

<div class="note">
<p>There is a plan in place to move this section to a new WD called "Page Floats".
</div>


<p>In page-based layouts, images and figures are often displayed at
the top or bottom of pages. This specificaton adds new keywords on the
'float' property to create <em>page floats</em>. A page float can
float inside its natural column/page, or its placement can be deferred
to a following column/page with the <em>float-defer</em> properties.
Page floats can be set to span several columns, thereby supporting
commonly used newspaper layouts. New values on the 'clear' property
adds further ways of refining layouts with page floats.

<p class=note>Not all multicol elements are constrained by the page
box. Therefore, a more accurate term for page floats may be <em>column
floats</em> as all of them are constrained by the column box. However,
in most cases, page floats seems like a better term.

<h3>Floating to the top/bottom: top, bottom, snap</h3>

<p>These new keywords on 'float' have been added:

<dl>

<dt>top
<dd>The float is floated to the top of the column

<dt>bottom
<dd>The float is floated to the bottom of the column


<dt>snap(&lt;length> &lt;length>? [, top | bottom | near ]?)

<dd><p>Makes the element float to the top or bottom if it naturally appears within a certain distance from the top or bottom. The length value(s) specifies the maxium distance from the top/bottom that an element must be within in order to be floated; one length value specifies the distance from both the top and the bottom, two length values specify the distance from the top and  bottom, respectively. 

<p>The optional keyword value specifies where the element is floated: top, bottom, or the nearest of the two. The initial value is 'near'. If 'near' is in effect and the element is within the specified distance both from the top and the bottom, bottom wins.

<p>An element is considered to be a float if it has a snap() value, even if the element does not appear within the specified distance. This way, it can be determined whether an element is float or not without laying out the document.

<dt>snap

<dd>same as <tt>snap(2em, near)</tt>

</dl>

<p>These new keywords only apply in paged media; in continous media
declarations with these keywords are ignored.

<p>Elements with any of these new keywords are called 'page floats'.
Each page float has a <em>natural column</em>, which is the column
where the element would have started to appears it it was not a float.
Also, each page float has a <em>natural page</em>, which is the page
where the element would have started if the was not a float. Unless
other constrained by lack of space or other float-* properties, page
floats should appear in their natural column on the natural page.

<div class=example>
<p>Float figure to top of natural column:
<pre>
.figure { float: top }
</pre>
<img alt="sample rendering" src=7.png>
</div>

<div class=example>
<pre>
.figure { float: top; width: 50% }
</pre>
<img alt="sample rendering" src=7b.png>
</div>

<div class=example>
<p>In this example, a figure naturally appears close to a column break. There is not enough space for the figure in the first column, and it is therefore placed in the second column, leaving white space at the bottom of the first column.</p>

<img alt="sample rendering" src=23.png>

<p>To avoid the white space, the image can be floated to the nearest edge (in the block direction):</p>

<pre>
.figure { float: snap }
</pre>

<p>In this example, the figure is already at the nearest edge, so it does not move. However, page floats allow subsequent content to be displayed before the page float and the white space can therefore be filled:</p>

<img alt="sample rendering" src=7.png>
</div>

<div class=example>

<p>In this example, two figures naturally appear in the text flow:</p>

<img alt="sample rendering" src=20.png>

<p>A typographer would typically try to avoid single lines of text above/below figures, which can be achieved with:

<pre>
div.figure { float: snap(1.5em) }
</pre>

<p>The length value specifies the reach of the snap function; in this example the second figure is affected, but not the first.
</div>

<div class=example>

<p>In this example, two figures naturally appear in the text flow:</p>

<img alt="sample rendering" src=20.png>

<p>To make the figures snap to the nearest edges, this code can be applied:

<pre>
div.figure { float: snap(2.5em) }
</pre>

<p>The resultant rendering is:</p>

<img alt="sample rendering" src=22.png>

</div>



<div class=example>

<p>Float figure to top of the natural column, spanning all columns:

<pre>
.figure { float: top; column-span: all }
</pre>

<img alt="sample redering" src=15.png>

</div>


<div class=example>
<p>In this example, tables will snap to the top/bottom if the top/bottom of the border box is closer than '3em' from the top/bottom of the page/column.

<pre>
table { float: snap }
table { float: snap(3em) }
table { float: snap(3em, bottom) }
table { float: snap(3em 2em, bottom) }
</pre>
</div>


<p class=issue>Do numeric values, to represent line numbers, make sense, like for orphans/widows?


<h3>Spanning columns</h3>

<p>The 'column-span' property is extended with integer values so that elements can span several columns. If the specified integer value is equal to, or larger than the number of columns in the multicol element, the number of columns spanned will be the same as if 'column-span: all' had been specified.

<div class=example>
<p>In this example, a commonly used newspaper layout is easily described:
<pre>
body { columns: 3 }
img.A { column-span: 2; width: 100% }  /* image spans two columns */
.one { column-span: 2 }                /* lead paragraph spans two columns */
</pre>
<img alt="sample rendering" src=regions.png>
</div>

<p>Further, the 'page' value is added to 'column-span' so that the page (and not the column or element) becomes the reference. 

<div class=example>
<p>In this example, the footer is floated to the bottom of the last page (and not the bottom of the article element):

<pre>
footer { float: bottom; column-span: page }

&lt;article>
  ...
  &lt;footer>...&lt;.footer>
&lt;/article>
</pre>
</div>

<p class=issue>An alternative way to express this would be to add a separate propertye, e.g., <code>float-reference: column | multicol | page</code></dfn>


<h3>Deferring floats: float-defer-column, float-defer-page</h3>

<p>A page float can be deferred to a following column/page with these new properties:

<h4>'float-defer-column'</h4>

<table class=propdef>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Name:</em>
      <td><dfn>float-defer-column</dfn>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Value:</em>
      <td>&ltinteger> | last | none
    <tr>
      <td><em>Initial:</em>
      <td>none
    <tr>
      <td><em>Applies to:</em>
      <td>page floats
    <tr>
      <td><em>Inherited:</em>
      <td>no
    <tr>
      <td><em>Percentages:</em>
      <td>N/A
    <tr>
      <td><em>Media:</em>
      <td>visual
    <tr>
      <td><em>Computed&nbsp;value:</em>
      <td>specified value
</table>


<h4>'float-defer-page'</h4>

<table class=propdef>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Name:</em>
      <td><dfn>float-defer-page</dfn>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Value:</em>
      <td>&ltinteger> | last | none
    <tr>
      <td><em>Initial:</em>
      <td>none
    <tr>
      <td><em>Applies to:</em>
      <td>page floats
    <tr>
      <td><em>Inherited:</em>
      <td>no
    <tr>
      <td><em>Percentages:</em>
      <td>N/A
    <tr>
      <td><em>Media:</em>
      <td>visual
    <tr>
      <td><em>Computed&nbsp;value:</em>
      <td>specified value
</table>


<p>These properties specify whether page floats should appear in their natural column/page, or in a following column/page. Values are:

<dl>
<dt>none
<dd>the page float appears in the natural column/page

<dt>&lt;integer>

<dd>A positive integer value indicates that the page float should be displayed in a following column/page. A negative integer value indicates that the page float should be displayed in a following column/page, counted from the last column/page. When counting columns, the starting point is the last column of the multicol element on the natural page. When counting pages, the starting point is the last page of the multicol element. 

</dl>


<div class=example>
<p>Float figure to the top of the column that follows the natural column:

<pre>
.figure { float: top }
.figure { float-defer-column: 1 }
</pre>
</div>

<div class=example>
<p>Float figure to the top of the next-to-last column:

<pre>
.figure { float: top; float-defer-column: -1 }
</pre>
<img alt="sample rendering" src=7.png>
</div>

<div class=example>
<p>Float figure to top of the last column of the multicol element on the current page:
<pre>
.figure { float: top; float-defer-column: last }
</pre>
<img alt="sample rendering" src=6.png>
</div>


<div class=example>
<p>In combination with 'column-span', the figure is floated to the top corner of the multicol element on that page:
<pre>
.figure { float: top; column-span: 2; float-defer-column: last; width: 100% }
</pre>
<img alt="sample rendering" src=8.png>
</div>


<div class=example>
<p>Float figure to the top of the second column, spanning two columns:

<pre>
.figure { 
  float: top; column-span: 2;
  float-defer-column: 1;
}
</pre>

<img alt="sample rendering" src=18.png>
</div>

<div class=example>
<p>Float figure to the top right, leaving one full column:

<pre>
.figure { 
  float: top; column-span: 2;
  float-defer-column: -1;
}
</pre>

<img alt="sample rendering" src=18.png>

<p>Given that there are four columnn, the same layout would be achived with this code:

<pre>
.figure { 
  float: top; column-span: 2;
  float-defer-column: 1;
}
</pre>


</div>



<div class=example>
<p>Float figure to the top of the first column on the next-to-last page:

<pre>
.figure { float: top }
.figure { float-defer-page: -1 }
</pre>
</div>

<div class=example>
<p>Float figure to the top of the next-to-last column on the next-to-last page:

<pre>
.figure { float: top }
.figure { float-defer-column: -1 }
.figure { float-defer-page: -1 }
</pre>
</div>

<dt>last

<dd>The page float should be displayed in the last colum, or on the last page.

<div class=example>
<p>Float figure to the top of the last column on the natural page:

<pre>
.figure { float: top }
.figure { float-defer-column: last }
</pre>

<img alt="sample rendering" src=6.png>
</div>

<div class=example>
<p>Float figure to the last column on the last page:

<pre>
.figure { float: top }
.figure { float-defer-column: last }
.figure { float-defer-page: last }
</pre>

</div>

<dt>none
<dd>The page floats should appear in their natural column/page, if possible. 

</dl>

<p>Zero is not a legal value.




<h3>Clearing page floats</h3>

<p>Page floats may request to not be stacked, or to be the only page float on a page/column through new values on the 'clear' property:

<dl>

<dt>top/bottom

<dd>The page float requests to be the only page float at the top/bottom of the column. If there is already a page float at the requested position, the page float is moved to the next column which does not have a page float in the requested position. 

<dt>column

<dd>The page float requests to be the only page float in the column. If there is already another page float on the page, the page float is moved to the next page which does not have a page float. 

<dt>page

<dd>The page float requests to be the only page float on the page. If there is already another page float on the page, the page float is moved to the next page which does not have a page float. 

</dl>


<div class=example>
<p>In this example, the two figures may appear in the same column:
<pre>
.figure { float: bottom; clear: none }

&ltdiv class=figure>&lt;/div>
&ltdiv class=figure>&lt;/div>
</pre>
<img src="16.png">
</div>

<div class=example>
<p>In this example, the two figures will appear in different columns:
<pre>
.figure { float: bottom; clear: column }

&ltdiv class=figure>&lt;/div>
&ltdiv class=figure>&lt;/div>
</pre>
<img src="17.png">
</div>


<div class=example>
<p>In this example, the two figures may appear at the bottom of the same column due to clearing only at the top:
<pre>
.figure { float: bottom; clear: top }

&ltdiv class=figure>&lt;/div>
&ltdiv class=figure>&lt;/div>
</pre>
<img src="16.png">
</div>

<div class=example>
<p>In this example, the two figures will appear in different columns due to clearing at the bottom:
<pre>
.figure { float: bottom; clear: bottom }

&ltdiv class=figure>&lt;/div>
&ltdiv class=figure>&lt;/div>
</pre>
<img src="17.png">
</div>


<div class=example>
<p>In this example, the two figures end up the top corner of two different pages:
<pre>
.figure { float: top; float-defer-column: last; clear: page }

&ltdiv class=figure>&lt;/div>
&ltdiv class=figure>&lt;/div>
</pre>
</div>

<div class=example>
<p>In this example, the two figures request different positions, and
they may therefore end up in the same column:
<pre>
.figure.one { float: top; clear: top }
.figure.two { float: bottom; clear: bottom }

&ltdiv class="figure one">&lt;/div>
&ltdiv class="figure two">&lt;/div>
</pre>
</div>




<h3>Floating inside and outside pages</h3>

<p>Two allow content to flow to the inside and outside of a page, these keywords are added to the 'float' property:

<dl>
   <dt>inside

   <dd>On a right page, this value is synonymous with 'left'. On a left page, this value is synonymous with 'right'.

   <dt>outside

   <dd>On a left page, this value is synonymous with 'left', On a right page, this value is synonymous with 'right'.

</dl>

<p>These new values do not create page floats, the are simply aliases for 'left' and 'right'.

<div class=example>
<pre>
.figure { float: outside }
</pre>
</div>


<p class=issue>Should there be a way to combine float: top/bottom with left/right?
<p class=issue>Should there be a way to delete page floats that end up lonesome on pages?


<h3>Wrapping around page floats</h3>

<table class=propdef>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Name:</em>
      <td><dfn>float-wrap</dfn>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Value:</em>
      <td>none | wrap 
    <tr>
      <td><em>Initial:</em>
      <td>none
    <tr>
      <td><em>Applies to:</em>
      <td>page floats
    <tr>
      <td><em>Inherited:</em>
      <td>no
    <tr>
      <td><em>Percentages:</em>
      <td>N/A
    <tr>
      <td><em>Media:</em>
      <td>visual
    <tr>
      <td><em>Computed&nbsp;value:</em>
      <td>specified value
</table>

<p>This property indicates whether other content may wrap around a page float:

<dl>
<dt>none

<dd>other content may not wrap around the page float

<dt>wrap

<dd>other content may wrap around the page float

</dl>

</dl>

<p>The 'intrude' value only works in combination with one of these keywords: 'left'/'right'/'top'/'bottom'/'top-corner'/'bottom-corner'.

<div class=example>

<pre class=css>
img { float: top; column-span: 2; float-wrap: wrap; width: 120%;  }
</pre>

<p>In this example, the image is wider than the column and will
therefore intrude into the neighboring column. At the bottom of the
middle column is a long word that is clipped in the middle of the
column gap.

<img alt="sample rendering" src=1.png>

</div>



<h3>The 'float-offset' property</h3>

<table class=propdef>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Name:</em>
      <td><dfn>float-offset</dfn>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Value:</em>
    <td>&lt;length> &lt;length> ?
    <tr>
      <td><em>Initial:</em>
      <td>0 0
    <tr>
      <td><em>Applies to:</em>
      <td>floated elements
    <tr>
      <td><em>Inherited:</em>
      <td>no
    <tr>
      <td><em>Percentages:</em>
      <td>see prose
    <tr>
      <td><em>Media:</em>
      <td>visual, paged
    <tr>
      <td><em>Computed&nbsp;value:</em>
      <td>one or two absolute lengths
</table>

<p>This property pushes a float in opposite direction of the where
it has been floated with 'float'. If one value is specified, it is
the horizontal offset. If two values are specified, the first is the
horizontal and the second is the vertical offset. If no vertical value
has been specified, the vertical offset is set to zero.

<p>This property can only influence a float along an axis it has been floated.

<div class=example>
<pre>
img {
  float: left;
  float-offset: 2em 3em;
}
</pre>

<p>In this example, the image is floated to the left. Therefore, 'float-offset' may only push the element in the horizontal direction, and the vertical value is ignored.

</div>

<p>Negative values are allowed; a negative values will push the float
in the same direction as it has been floated with 'float'

<p>This property may move floats into other column than where they
naturally appear.

<div class=example>
<pre>img {
  float: right;
  float-offset: 5px;
}
</pre>

<img alt="sample rendering" src=14.png>

</div>

<p>Percentage values are computed according to this formula:

<pre>
  (containing-block-width - float-width) * percentage
  (containing-block-height - float-height) * percentage
</pre>


<div class=example>
Pull quotes are often centered in a column. In this example, the pull quote is floated to the right, and then pushed back into the center.

<img width=213 src="exclusion_wrap_side_left.png">

<pre>
.pullquote {
  float: right;
  float-offset: 50%; /* 50% centers the box */
}
</pre>

</div>


<p>When negative values are set on this property, the column gap is also part of the calculation:

<pre>
  ((containing-block-width + 2 * column-gap) - float-width) * percentage
</pre>

<div class=example>
<pre>img {
  float: top right;
  float-offset: -50% 3em;  /* 50% centers the box */
  width: 120%;
}
</pre>

<img alt="sample rendering" src=11.png>

</div>


<div class="example">

<pre>
img {
  float: top right;
  float-offset: -80% 2em;
  width: 100%;
}
</pre>

<img alt="sample rendering" src=12.png>

</div>

-->


<!--

<h3>Overconstrained page floats</h3>

<p>In many cases, the specified values on these properties cannot be honored. 

<div class=example>The number of columns is limited, and high values therefore cannot be honored:
<pre>
.figure { float: top; float-defer-column: 1000 }
</pre>
</div>

<div class=example>A narrow screen may only have room for one column, in which case this request cannot be honored:
<pre>
.figure { float: top; float-defer-column: -5 }
</pre>
</div>

<div class=example>In long documents, all content cannot fit on the last page, and this rule therefore cannot be honored:
<pre>
p { float: top; float-defer-page: last }
</pre>
</div>

<p>Page floats are processed in the order they appear in the source. However, the visual order of page floats may not ne the same as the source order. 

<div class=example>Consider this code:

<pre>
.one { float: top; float-defer-page: last; column-span: all }
.two { float: top; clear: column }

&lt;div class=one>&lt;/div>
&lt;div class=two>&lt;/div>
</pre>

<p>In this example, the first element requests to appear on the last page, while the second element requests to appear in the natural column. If the natural column of the second element appears on a page before the last page, the second element will appear visually before the first. 

</div>


<div class=example>Consider this code:

<pre>
.one { float: top; float-defer-page: last; column-span: all }
.two { float: top; clear: column }

&lt;div class=one>&lt;/div>
&lt;div class=two>&lt;/div>
</pre>

<p>If all content can fit on one page, the first page will also be the last page. The first element is processed first and is placed on top of the first page. Then the second element is processed. It reqests a clear top, somthing which is not possible on the first page. Therefore, a second page is created and the first element is moved there. Even if the first element requests to be on the last page, it will not appear there.
</div>

<p>When resolving over-constrained layouts, the order of importance for defined goals are:

<ol>
<li>honor basic multi-column layout ('columns', 'column-span: all', 'column-gap' etc)
<li>honor 'column-span: &lt;integer>'
<li>honor 'clear: top/bottom/pcolumn/page'
<li>honor 'float-defer-page'
<li>honor 'float-defer-column'
<li>honor 'float: top/bottom'
<li>display all content (as described by other CSS properties)
<li>keep the number of pages to a minimum
</ol>
-->



<h2>Selecting columns and pages</h2>

<p class=XXX>This section is fairly sketchy.

<h3>Selecting certain named pages</h3>

<p>In CSS2, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/page.html#page-selectors">first, left and right pages</a> can be selected. This specification extends pages selectors:


<div class=example>
<p>In this example, the first page of an article will have a pink background, and the second will be lime:
<pre>
@page funky:nth(1) { background: pink }
@page funky:nth(2) { background: lime }
article { page: funky }
</pre>
</div>

<p>The grammar of allowed arguments to nth() is the same as the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#nth-child-pseudo">nth-child() pseudo-class</a>.

<div class=example>
<p>In this example, pages in a document will cycle through pink, lime and white backgrounds:
<pre>
@page :nth(3n) { background: pink }
@page :nth(3n+1)) { background: lime }
@page :nth(3n+2)) { background: white }
</pre>
</div>


<h2>Page groups</h2>

<p>Named pages can appear in sequence, stemming from different elements. A sequnce of named pages with the same name is called a <em>page group</em>. The 'page-group' property expresses whether an element starts a new page group or not.

<table class=propdef>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Name:</em>
      <td><dfn>page-group</dfn>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Value:</em>
    <td>auto | start 
    <tr>
      <td><em>Initial:</em>
      <td>auto
    <tr>
      <td><em>Applies to:</em>
      <td>elements with 'page' value other than auto

<p>This property determines whether the element starts a new page group or not. 

<dl>
<dt>auto
<dd>The element only starts a new page group if 'page' has a named page different from the the previous element.

<dt>start
<dd>The element always starts a new page group.

</dl>


<div class=example>

<p>In this example, each article starts a new page group so that the first page of each article has a pink background.

<pre>
@page funky:first {
  background: pink;
}
article {
  page: funky;
  page-group: start;
}
</pre>

<p>Without the 'page-group: start' declaration, only the first page of the first article would be pink.

</div>



<h3>Selecting elements within pages and columns</h3>


<p>The 'page()' and 'column()' pseudo-elements allows the selection of
pages, columns, and elements within.


<div class=example>
<pre>
article::column(2n) {     /* select every other column of an article */
  ...
}
</pre>
</div>

<div class=example>
<pre>
div.chapter::column(3)       /* the 3rd column of the element */
div.chapter::column(2n)      /* all even columns of the element */
div.chapter::column(3+)      /* all columns but the 1st and 2nd */
div.chapter::column(2,2)     /* second column on second page */
div.chapter::column(*,2)     /* all columns on the second page */
div.chapter::column(1,*)     /* the first column on all pages */
</pre>
</div>


<div class=example>
<pre>
article::page(left) {   /* select all left pages in an article */
  background: pink;
} 
</pre>
</div>


<div class=example>
<pre>
article::page(left) p {   /* select all p elements that appear on left pages in an article */
  text-align: left;
} 
</pre>
</div>

<p>It is also possible to place the code inside @page:

<div class=example>
<p>These are identical:

<pre>
@page :left {
  {
    p { text-align: left } 
  }
}

::page(left) p { text-align: left }
</pre>

<p class=XXX>Is "left" a pseudo-class or pseudo-element? In @page, ":left" is a pseudo-class. However, when we select elements on left pages, it acts like a pseudo-element.</p>

</div>



</div>

<div class=example>
<p>This syntax also allows the selection and styling of elements inside margin boxes:

<pre>
@page :left {
  background: pink;            /* declaration applies to pages */
  {
    p { text-align: left }     /* declaration applies to elements on page */
  }
  @top-center {
    background: orange;        /* declaration applies to margin box */
    {
      p { text-align: left }   /* declaration applies to elements in margin box */
    }
  }
}
</pre>
</div>





<h2>Baseline alignement</h2>

<p class=XXX>Placeholder</p>

<!--
<p>In multi-column layouts, baselines are typically aligned between
adjacent columns. This gives the presentation a visual rythm, and text
in the end of the columns will be alignend. To support this, a new
value on the <span class=property>'line-box-contain'</span> property is
defined: ''line-grid'' (or, perhaps, ''gap'', ''crack'', ''snap'', ''snap-gap'', ''void'', ''grid'', ''snap-to-grid'').

<p>The value means that the height of the line in which the element
occurs should be rounded up to the smallest multiple of the used
'line-height' value on the containing block.

<div class=example>
<p>In this example, the stacking height of div.figure would be 30px (2 * 15px)

<pre>
div.multicol { line-height: 15px }
div.figure { height: 20px; line-box-contain: block inline replaced line-grid }
</pre>
</div>

<!--
<p class=note>The <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-linebox/#LineStacking">line-box-contain</a> property is defined in <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-linebox">CSS3 module: line</a>.

<p class=note>A similar idea &mdash; 'line-stacking-strategy: grid-height' &mdash; was proposed in a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-linebox/#line-stacking-strategy">previous version of the CSS3 line module</a>. The 'line-stacking-strategy' property is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xsl/#line-stacking-strategy">used in XSL</a>.
